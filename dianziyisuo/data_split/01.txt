Abstract:Complex international partnerships have emerged as a policy instrument of choice for many governments to build domestic capacity in science, technology and innovation with the help of foreign partners. At present, these flagship initiatives tend to be primarily practitioner-driven with limited systematic understanding of available design options and trade-offs. Here, we present an analysis of four such partnerships from the university sector between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and governments in the UK, Portugal, Abu Dhabi, and Singapore. Using a system architecture approach in conjunctions with in-depth case studies and elements of interpretive policy analysis, we map how in each country distinct capacity-building goals, activities, and political and institutional contexts translate into different partnership architectures: a bilateral hub-&amp;-spokes architecture (UK), a consortium architecture (Portugal), an institution-building architecture (Abu Dhabi), and a functional expansion architecture (Singapore). Despite these differences in emergent macro-architectures, we show that each partnership draws on an identical, limited set of 'forms' that can by organized around four architectural views (education, research, innovation &amp; entrepreneurship, institution-building) and four levels of interaction between partners (people, programs/projects, objects, organization/process). Based on our analysis, we derive a design matrix that can help guide the development future partnerships through a systematic understanding of available design choices. Our research underscores the utility and flexibility of complex international partnerships as systemic policy instruments. It suggests a greater role for global research universities in capacity-building and international development, and emphasizes the potential of targeted cross-border funding. Our research also demonstrates the analytic power of system architecture for policy analysis and design. We argue that architectural thinking provides a useful stepping stone for STS-type interpretive policy analysis into national innovation initiatives in different political cultures, as well as more custom-tailored approaches to program evaluation. &copy; 2015 The Authors.

Abstract:The stability and synchronization analysis of two chaotic Rulkov maps coupled by bidirectional and symmetric chemical synapses are taken into account. As a function of intrinsic control parameters &alpha;, &sigma;, &eta;, reversal potential v, synaptic parameters &theta;, k, and external chemical coupling strength g<inf>c</inf>, conditions for stability of a fixed point for this system are derived. Some typical domains are chosen for numerical simulations which include time evolution of transmembrane voltages and phase portraits, and both of them are presented for theoretical analysis. Based on the master stability functions approach and calculation of the maximum Lyapunov exponents of synchronization errors, synchronized regions of the coupled neurons and a strip-shaped chaotic structure in parameter-space are obtained. Specially, given some values of control parameter &alpha;, we propose interval ranges of coupling strength g<inf>c</inf>in which the two chaotic Rulkov map-based neurons can be synchronized completely. It is shown that there exist different transition mechanisms of the neuronal spiking and bursting synchronization. The synchronized regions will become smaller and smaller as control parameter &alpha; or synaptic parameter &theta; increases. Nevertheless, the coupled neurons can at first transit from desynchrony to in-phase synchronization, and then to complete synchronization as chemical coupling strength g<inf>c</inf>increases. Compared with control parameter &alpha; and synaptic parameter &theta;, chemical coupling strength g<inf>c</inf>plays an opposite role in the process of synchronization transition. These findings could be useful for further understanding the role of two chaotic Rulkov maps coupled by bidirectional and symmetric chemical synapses in the field of cooperative behaviors of coupled neurons. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:In the present work, a generalized solution for the vibration of functionally graded microbeam is studied. A vibrational response is presented for a microbeam subjected to a ramp-type heating and which has functionally varying material properties through its thickness. The governing equations of the generalized thermoelasticity without energy dissipation proposed by Green and Naghdi are presented. An analytical technique based on Laplace transform is used to calculate the vibration of deflection and the temperature. The inverses of Laplace transforms are computed numerically using Fourier expansion techniques. The effect of the ramping time parameter is studied on the lateral vibration, the temperature, the displacement, the stress, the bending thermal moment, and the strain energy of the functionally graded microbeam. The influence of the thickness of the beam is also analyzed. &copy; 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Abstract:Electrode and electrolytes are always playing a key role in developing good efficient devices. This paper reports the synthesis, characterization and application of low viscosity ionic liquid (1-ethyl 3-methyl imidazolium dicyanamide) incorporated into polymer matrix (PVDF-HFP). The samples were characterized using various experimental tools. Complex impedance spectroscopy shows that conductivity of polymer host increases with increasing ionic liquid (IL) concentration attains maxima and then decreases. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals the reduction of crystalline matrix of polymer host by adding IL. The primarily fabricated devices using maximum conductivity film affirms that this material is promising candidate for dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and supercapacitor application. &copy; 2015 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

Abstract:The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the stability of cosmetic formulations containing botanical extracts of A&ccedil;ai, Chamomile and Green Tea, promising adjuvants in cosmetic preparations. The extracts were previously submitted to photostability and antioxidant activity studies. Antioxidant activity was determined by chemiluminescence and the total phenolic content by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. Photostability of the extracts was also determined in the formulations after these have been developed. Experimental formulations were prepared containing extracts of A&ccedil;ai, Chamomile and Green Tea and submitted to accelerated stability studies, determination of rheological properties and to sensorial analysis. Results showed that all extracts had a potential antioxidant effect, Green Tea being the most promising one. It had the highest total phenolic content, which may explain the difference observed. The formulation containing Green Tea extract also showed the best performance in sensorial analysis. It is concluded that all extracts seem to have promising properties for use in cosmetic formulations. Green Tea extract, however, had a significant performance in all studies. &copy; 2015.

Abstract:If robots are to invade our homes and offices, they will have to interact more naturally with humans. Natural interaction will certainly include the ability of robots to plan their motion, accounting for the social norms enforced. In this paper we propose a novel solution for Human-AwareNavigation resorting to external omnidirectional static cameras, used to implement a vision-based person tracking system. The proposed solution was tested in a typical domestic indoor scenario in four different experiments. The results show that the robot is able to cope with human-aware constraints, defined after common proxemics rules. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

Abstract:Motion planning has evolved from coping with simply geometric problems to physics-based ones that incorporate the kinodynamic and the physical constraints imposed by the robot and the physical world. Therefore, the criteria for evaluating physics-based motion planners goes beyond the computational complexity (e.g. in terms of planning time) usually used as a measure for evaluating geometrical planners, in order to consider also the quality of the solution in terms of dynamical parameters. This study proposes an evaluation criteria and analyzes the performance of several kinodynamic planners, which are at the core of physics-based motion planning, using different scenarios with fixed and manipulatable objects. RRT, EST, KPIECE and SyCLoP are used for the benchmarking. The results show that KPIECE computes the time-optimal solution with heighest success rate, whereas, SyCLoP compute the most power-optimal solution among the planners used. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

Abstract:In this article, the extended finite element method is employed to solve problems, including weak and strong discontinuities. To this end, a level set framework is used to represent the discontinuities location, and the Heaviside and Branch function are included in the standard finite element method. The case of two arbitrary curved cracks is solved numerically and stress intensity factor (SIF) values at the crack tips are calculated based on the evaluation of the crack tip opening displacement. Afterwards, J-integral methodology is adopted to evaluate the SIFs for isotropic and anisotropic bi-material interface crack problems. Numerical results are verified with those presented in the literature. &copy; 2016 Taylor & Francis, Group, LLC.

Abstract:Let &Omega; be a domain in &Rdbl;<sup>n</sup>or a noncompact Riemannian manifold of dimension n &ge; 2, and 1 &lt; p &lt; &infin;.

The aim of the paper is to generalize to the quasilinear case (p &ne; 2) some of the results obtained in [6]for the linear case (p=2), and in particular, to obtain "as large as possible" nonnegative (optimal) Hardy-type weight W satisfying (Equation Presented) Our main results deal with the case where V=0, and &Omega; is a general punctured domain (for V &ne; 0 we obtain only some partial results). In the case 1 &lt; p &le; n, an optimal Hardy-weight is given by (Equation Presented) where G is the associated positive minimal Green function with a pole at 0. On the other hand, for p &gt; n, several cases should be considered, depending on the behavior of G at infinity in &Sigma;.

Abstract:We present a density functional study of various hydrogen vacancies located on a single hexagonal ring of graphane (fully hydrogenated graphene) considering the effects of charge states and the position of the Fermi level. We find that uncharged vacancies that lead to a carbon sublattice balance are energetically favorable and are wide band gap systems just like pristine graphane. Vacancies that do create a sublattice imbalance introduce spin polarized states into the band gap, and exhibit a half-metallic behavior with a magnetic moment of 1.00 &mu;<inf>B</inf>per vacancy. The results show the possibility of using vacancies in graphane for novel spin-based applications. When charging such vacancy configurations, the deep donor (+1/0) and deep acceptor (0/-1) transition levels within the band gap are noted. We also note a half-metallic to metallic transition and a significant reduction of the induced magnetic moment due to both negative and positive charge doping. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:This article deals with a numerical solution for combined radiation and conduction heat transfer in a gray absorbing and emitting medium applied to a two-dimensional domain using triangular meshes. The radiative transfer equation was solved using the high order Discontinuous Galerkin method with an upwind numerical flux. The energy equation was discretized using a high order finite element method. Stability and error analysis were performed for the Discontinuous Galerkin method to solve radiative transfer equation. A new algorithm to solve the nonlinear radiative-conductive heat transfer systems was introduced and different types of boundary conditions were considered in numerical simulations. The proposed technique's high performance levels in terms of accuracy and stability are discussed in this paper with numerical examples given. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract:A multitude of factors determine the increase in demand for large varieties of any particular product. This rise in demand is forcing firms to indulge in mass customization of their products. Platform based innovation that facilitates the production of a large variety of products from the same base or family is an offshoot of the product family approach. While a plethora of frameworks exist in extant research for analyzing and implementing best innovation practices, most of them fail to take into account environmental regulations enforced by the governments of the land for planning and executing production plans. We develop a new framework Strategic Platform Innovation Star (SPINS) to analyze and plan the implementation of platform development under environmental regulatory constraints among other factors. We validate the framework through a case study on Bosch India that developed a successful product platform to meet customer demands under regulatory considerations. We analyze the innovation effort at Bosch India using the various components of the proposed framework. The proposed framework extends the literature on product innovation by allowing the analysis of contextual factors and studying its impact on product platform development at firms. The case study on Bosch India shows that a product platform provides a much needed cushion against regulatory challenges and the presence of a strong innovation culture and collaborative development efforts help in quickly responding to the dynamic competitive landscape and launching new products. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:The problem of task assignment for multiple cooperating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) teams is considered. Multiple UAVs forming several small teams are needed to perform attack tasks on a set of predetermined ground targets. A hierarchical task assignment method is presented to address the problem. It breaks the original problem down to three levels of sub-problems: target clustering, cluster allocation and target assignment. The first two sub-problems are centrally solved by using clustering algorithms and integer linear programming, respectively, and the third sub-problem is solved in a distributed and parallel manner, using a mixed integer linear programming model and an improved ant colony algorithm. The proposed hierarchical method can reduce the computational complexity of the task assignment problem considerably, especially when the number of tasks or the number of UAVs is large. Experimental results show that this method is feasible and more efficient than non-hierarchical methods.

Abstract:We proposed and demonstrated a new all-polymer based fabrication process for an all-polymer flexible and parallel optical interconnect cable in which a vertical light coupler is integrated. The approach potentially cut down the cost by eliminating a metallization process for alignment of multiple masks. Throughout the process we used a polyimide as the substrate, coated by Epoclad as claddings, then AP2210B and WPR 5100 were used to fabricate waveguides and 45 degree mirror couplers, respectively. In addition, precisely aligned mirror couplers to waveguides are achieved by using polymer-based, non-metallic, and transparent phase-based alignment marks. We tested a feature specific phase-based alignment system. In addition, the shape and depth of the phase-based alignment marks are optimized for phase contrast and Schlieren imaging. Our results shows that a contrast of the image is enhanced compared to that of observed by a conventional imaging system. Such process enables to integrate polymer based waveguides by only using the polymer based alignment marks on the WPR 5100 layer.

Abstract:The basic theory of seismic wave absorption and attenuation is described in this paper, and methods to estimate quality factors by centroid frequency shift (CFS) can be classified into different categories, such as Gaussian CFS, MBMSW CFS, Ricker CFS, weighted CFS, modified weighted CFS, impulse CFS, Taylor CFS. Model and VSP data tests show three conclusions as follows. Firstly, the longer travel time of seismic wavelet is, the smaller centroid frequency is; when travel time is small, centroid frequency has a linear relationship with travel time; otherwise, the relationship between them is hyperbolic. Secondly, the smaller Q value is, the faster the decline of centroid frequency is. Finally, Gaussian CFS and Taylor CFS are with higher accuracy when travel time is small, weighted CFS needs higher requirements for spectral fitting; the accuracy of other methods is relatively lower than above methods. &copy; 2015, Science Press.

Abstract:Processor fault diagnosis plays an important role in measuring the reliability of a multiprocessor system, and the diagnosabilities of many well-known multiprocessor systems have been investigated. The conditional diagnosability has been widely accepted as a new measure of diagnosability by assuming an additional condition that any faulty set can't contain all the neighbors of any node in a multiprocessor system. In this paper, we explore algebraic and combinatorial properties of burnt pancake networks, and investigate the structural vulnerability as well as super and extra connectivities. Furthermore, we show that the classic diagnosability and the conditional diagnosability of n-dimensional burnt pancake network BP<inf>n</inf>(n&ge;4) are n and 3n-4, respectively. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:JLP (JNK-associated leucine zipper protein) is a scaffolding protein that interacts with various signaling proteins associated with coordinated regulation of cellular process such as endocytosis, motility, neurite outgrowth, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Here we identified PLK1 (Polo-like kinase 1) as a novel interaction partner of JLP through mass spectrometric approaches. Our results indicate that JLP is phospho-primed by PLK1 on Thr-351, which is recognized by the Polo box domain of PLK1 leading to phosphorylation of JLP at additional sites. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture and quantitative LC-MS/MS analysis was performed to identify PLK1-dependent JLP-interacting proteins. Treatment of cells with the PLK1 kinase inhibitor BI2536 suppressed binding of the Forkhead box protein K1 (FOXK1) transcriptional repressor to JLP. JLP was found to interact with PLK1 and FOXK1 during mitosis. Moreover, knockdown of PLK1 affected the interaction between JLP and FOXK1. FOXK1 is a known transcriptional repressor of the CDK inhibitor p21/WAF1, and knockdown of JLP resulted in increased FOXK1 protein levels and a reduction of p21 transcript levels. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which FOXK1 protein levels and activity are regulated by associating with JLP and PLK1. &copy; 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

Abstract:Although mechanical pulp can be considered as a potential raw material for preparation of microfibrils, suitable pre-treatment methods have been missing. Consequently, the objectives of this study were firstly to find a suitable procedure to prepare lignocellulose microfibrils (LCMF) from fractionated thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) and secondly to evaluate if these TMP-based materials could be used as paper additives to increase paper strength. Carboxymethylation was found to be a suitable pretreatment for both TMP fines and TMP fibres to enable preparation of individualised LCMF after subsequent homogenisation treatment. After air drying, this material formed dense continuous films in conformity with films prepared from cellulose microfibrils (CMF) originating from chemical pulp. Homogenisation only or sulphonation followed by homogenisation did not fibrillate the TMP samples into individualised LCMF. Analysis of paper properties showed that addition of 20% LCMF to a standard TMP furnish improved tensile strength index by 15%. The LCMF-containing papers were also more brittle (less elongation) than the other paper sheets in this study. Similar tensile strength index was also obtained for TMP fines treated by sulphonation followed by homogenisation.

Abstract:Lossy compression of hyperspectral image based on vector quantization algorithms can achieve a high compression ratio, but it is of time complexity and great distortion. This article proposed a new fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) algorithm based on simulated annealing. Firstly, the dimensions were reduced by using the algorithm of adaptive band combination dimensional reduction (ABC), then the number of clusters with the elbow was determined. FCM was combined with simulated annealing, and found optimal result quickly, then recovered dimensions. We got optimization coding by deblurring U. Through this approach, the efficiency has been improved and the distortions have been reduced greatly. &copy; 2015, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. All right reserved.

Abstract:The hypercomputation debate consists of deciding upon the possibility of constructing a hypercomputing device. Amongst potential building strategies, strategy O &ndash; where O stands for oracle &ndash; refers to the construction of a device that could hypercompute with the aid of a physical oracle, namely external information coming from nature. Although a number of oracular devices have been devised, they are not generally considered as viable proposals, especially given they supposedly involve conceptual and physical issues. This article is intended to defend strategy O though. It will be argued that strategy O is unfairly criticised, for criticisms are largely the result of misunderstandings about what physical oracles are and what they are capable of. This will allow the concept of an oracle to be better understood, so that the hypercomputation debate can make progress. &copy; 2015 Old City Publishing, Inc.

Abstract:Replicated data types store copies of identical data across multiple servers in a distributed system. For the replicas to satisfy strong eventual consistency, these data types should be designed to guarantee conflict free convergence of all copies in the presence of concurrent updates. This requires maintaining history related metadata that, in principle, is unbounded. While earlier work such as [2] and [9] has concentrated on declarative frameworks for formally specifying Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) and conditions that guarantee the existence of finite-state (distributed) reference implementations, there has not been a systematic attempt so far to use the declarative specifications for effective verification of CRDTs. In this work, we propose a simple global reference implementation for CRDTs specified declaratively, and simple conditions under which this is guaranteed to be finite. Our implementation uses the technique of Later Appearance Record (LAR). We also outline a methodology for effective verification of CRDT implementations using CEGAR. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Abstract:In order to study the effect of laser shock processing on low cycle fatigue behavior of extruded AZ80-T6 magnesium alloy, laser shock peening (LSP) and warm laser shock peening (WLSP) have been carried out on fatigue specimens using Nd: glass laser as well as tensile-tensile fatigue test. The results show that residual compressive stresses generated by LSP and WLSP at 300 are -125 MPa and -158 MPa, and their fatigue lifes are improved by 11.42% and 75.74%, respectively. The crack initiation time is delayed obviously by WLSP so that fatigue life of AZ80-T6 alloy is improved. Laser shock induced microstructures of magnesium alloy and low cycle fatigue behavior are analyzed and discussed. &copy; 2015, Chinese Laser Press. All right reserved.

Abstract:Simultaneous cultivation of microorganisms in the specially designed experimental laboratory plant with five bioreactors system is a difficult problem. An especially important issue is the realization of the biomass biocoenosis stimulation by controlling the ratio of the dosed substrates. Such control requires a constant attendance by a two-person team of experimenters - the process operator and a measurement and analysis expert. In this paper, the necessity to carefully select the appropriate (well-cooperating) two-person teams for the operation of the process is discussed. An architecture of the &ldquo;human-in-the-loop&rdquo; control system is presented in which such control is proposed to be applied. The division of work between the cooperating experimenters has been discussed, taking into account its influence on proper cooperation. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Abstract:The proposed general ecological monitoring algorithm consists of the following steps: (a) current and forecast meteorological data checking; (b) simulation of the pollutants dissipation corresponding to (a) and to the normative values of the pollutants volumes from the industrial plants pollution sources; (c) intelligent decision making on the direct near-earth pollutants concentrations measurements necessity; (d) in the case of such necessity mobile ecological laboratory dislocation for the pollution level checking; (e) the decision making on the pollution results prevention. The presenting particular results, which concern to the steps (c) and (d) were carried out in the two-level checkup structure. The lower level supplies the preliminary handled results of the concentration measurements in the points prescribed by the upper level. The problems to be solved at the upper level include the necessary measurements points placing estimation and the mobile laboratory route elaboration. The approach to these problems decision is formulated as the distant indirect pollutants sources volumes identification by means of the direct concentrations measurements data mining.

Abstract:In this study, corrosion behaviour of porous NiTi modified by plasma sprayed alumina coating has been investigated. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques were applied for the morphology and microstructure characterisation, while linear sweep voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used for investigation of corrosion behaviour of coated and uncoated NiTi specimens. Induced couple plasma was conducted to measure ion release of the specimens in simulated body fluid at 37&deg;C. The plasma sprayed Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>coating on the porous NiTi improved the surface characteristics for biomedical applications. The alumina coating significantly hampered Ni ion release from the surface. In spite of slight decrease in corrosion resistance of the coated specimens, the corrosion mechanism changed from pitting to general corrosion. The breakdown phenomenon was not detected in the coated specimens, as well. Overall, it can be concluded the longevity of the coated specimen in the simulated biological system was enhanced, comparing to bare NiTi specimens. &copy; 2015 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

Abstract:Automatic bug fixing has become a promising direction for reducing manual effort in debugging. However, general approaches to automatic bug fixing may face some fundamental difficulties. In this paper, we argue that automatic fixing of specific types of bugs can be a useful complement. This paper reports our first attempt towards automatically fixing memory leaks in C programs. Our approach generates only safe fixes, which are guaranteed not to interrupt normal execution of the program. To design such an approach, we have to deal with several challenging problems such as inter-procedural leaks, global variables, loops, and leaks from multiple allocations. We propose solutions to all the problems and integrate the solutions into a coherent approach. We implemented our inter-procedural memory leak fixing into a tool named LeakFix and evaluated LeakFix on 15 programs with 522k lines of code. Our evaluation shows that LeakFix is able to successfully fix a substantial number of memory leaks, and LeakFix is scalable for large applications. &copy; 2015 IEEE.

Abstract:Currently, it is crucial for researchers to know if others have similar research objectives. Nevertheless, the identification of authors sharing the same motivations and interests may be complex, as the amount of research publications is growing rapidly. Furthermore, information about research papers is often fragmented and incomplete. The incomplete information, or metadata, in this paper refers to abstracts, keywords, journals, organizations, and so on. Thus, this paper analyses the metadata information about an author to find out similar authors. Author Similarity Model, a novel language model which is evolved from Author Topic Model, has been developed in this paper. For author similarity modeling, a four-dimensional vector has been set up to describe every author. Therefore an author&rsquo;s neighbours (a group of people who have the same direction of research) can be found out by calculating similarity between vectors. &copy; 2015 Taylor & Francis Group.

Abstract:Sequentialization has been shown to be an effective symbolic verification technique for concurrent C programs using POSIX threads. Lazy-CSeq, a tool that applies a lazy sequentialization scheme, has won the Concurrency division of the last two editions of the Competition on Software Verification. The tool encodes all thread schedules up to a given bound into a single non-deterministic sequential C program and then invokes a C model checker. This paper presents a novel optimized implementation of lazy sequentialization, which integrates symbolic pruning of redundant schedules into the encoding. Experimental evaluation shows that our tool outperforms Lazy-CSeq significantly on many benchmarks. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Abstract:We report experimental progress in weakening the frequency difference lock-in phenomenon in a Y-shaped cavity dual-frequency laser. A cube coil pair is chosen to provide a uniform magnetic field for tunability and uniformity of magnetic field strength. When the transverse magnetic field intensity is 9 mT, the frequency difference lock-in phenomenon is evidently weakened and the frequency difference can be continuously tuned in the range of 0.12 MHz to 1.15 GHz. Moreover, the relationship between the minimal frequency difference and magnetic field intensity are investigated and discussed. Then a Y-shaped cavity dual-frequency laser is expected to be utilized as an optimum light source for heterodyne interferometric sensing and precise laser measurement. &copy; 2015 Chinese Optics Letters.

Abstract:Sugarcane is a very important bioenergy crop for Brazil and drip irrigation a major tool for increasing its productivity. The experiment was conducted at "Luiz de Queiroz" College of Agriculture (USP) in Piracicaba-SP. Treatments were arranged in a factorial design (4x4x8) with split-split-plot with three replicates, totaling 128 treatments and 384 plots. The evaluated irrigation depths (L50, L 75 and L100L125) were variations in the fraction applied over time, relative to the L100 treatment where soil moisture remained close to field capacity (Bec) throughout the experiment. Each tested variety had its own reference L100 based on digital tensiometer readings and datalogger acquisition system. The intensities of water deficit during maturation were evaluated for M1 (moderate water deficit of long duration), M2 (intensive water deficit of long duration), M3 (no water deficit) and M4 (severe water deficit of short duration). The sugarcane yield (TCH) was favored by the combination L100 and M3, regardless of the studied variety, with an estimated average value of 232.2 t ha'1. Among the varieties, V4 had the highest TCH, with average of averaging 250.4 t ha1 for L100. The V1, V2, V4 and V6 varieties, for irrigation depth L100, did not differ significantly for TCH and had the highest average1. Thus, one should consider the possibility of full drip irrigation, instead of the deficit one, for sugarcane.

Abstract:Au and Pt hollow capsules with single holes were synthesized via a Pickering emulsion strategy. Pickering emulsions provided particles with oil-water interfaces as asymmetric platform for anisotropic structure sculpture. Reactive Cu<inf>2</inf>O particles were utilized not only as emulsifier to prepare Pickering emulsions but also as sacrificed hard template for the consequent asymmetric galvanic reaction at the oil-water interfaces, resulting in the formation of open-mouthed Au and Pt hollow capsules. The opened hollow structure can facilitate the diffusion of reactants to inner side of the shell wall, thus effectively activating the catalytic activity of the inner shell wall of the hollow capsules. The obtained open-mouthed Au hollow capsules show much higher catalytic performance than that of intact Au hollow capsules. &copy; 2015 American Chemical Society.

Abstract:Periodic nanostructure arrays have been ubiquitously exploited lately due to their properties and prospective applications in production of templates for self-induced and gold (Au)-catalysed nanowires (NWs), because this approach is relatively cheap, time-efficient and do not require electron beam lithography. The technique consists creating nanoholes in SiO<inf>2</inf>to expose the silicon Si (111) beneath where self-induced NWs can nucleate, while nanodots deposited onto the Si (111) surface serve as catalyst seeds. For Au-catalysed NWs, a monolayer of self-assembled polystyrene nanospheres (PNS 300nm) was created on a 2 inch Si wafer by spin coating and later etched for a short time before a very thin Au-catalyst layer was deposited. In turn, for self-induced, PNS monolayer was created onto a SiO<inf>2</inf>-Si substrate. A longer etch was required to reduce PNS diameter significantly to leave relatively larger spacing where chromium is blanket deposited. PNS were lifted off by sonicating the samples in toluene produce the periodic arrays of nanodots and nanoholes, respectively. The underlying SiO<inf>2</inf>was etched further through the nanoholes to uncover the Si below. 200 nm holes and 30-70 nm dots were demonstrated through the bespoke methods. The patterned substrates served as master templates, subsequently copied using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to produce a flexible stamp for nanoimprint lithography. A bilayer resist lift off process was developed to print the replicated nanodots or nanoholes on large-area substrates onto which III-V NWs can be grown.

Otsu method can provide satisfactory result for thresholding an image with a histogram of clear bimodal distribution. This method, however, fails if the variance or the class probability of the object is much smaller than that of the background. In order to introduce more information of the image, a gradient weighted threholding method is presented, which weighs the objective function of the Otsu method with the gray level and gradient mapping (GGM) function. It makes the between-class variance of the thresholded image maximize and the threshold locate as close to the boundary of the object and the background as possible. The experimental results on optical images as well as infrared images show the effectiveness of the proposed method. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Abstract:Water waves are increasingly regarded as a promising source for large-scale energy applications. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been recognized as one of the most promising approaches for harvesting wave energy. This work examines a freestanding, fully enclosed TENG that encloses a rolling ball inside a rocking spherical shell. Through the optimization of materials and structural parameters, a spherical TENG of 6 cm in diameter actuated by water waves can provide a peak current of 1 &mu;A over a wide load range from a short-circuit condition to 10 G&Omega;, with an instantaneous output power of up to 10 mW. A multielectrode arrangement is also studied to improve the output of the TENG under random wave motions from all directions. Moreover, at a frequency of 1.43 Hz, the wave-driven TENG can directly drive tens of LEDs and charge a series of supercapacitors to rated voltage within several hours. The stored energy can power an electronic thermometer for 20 min. This rolling-structured TENG is extremely lightweight, has a simple structure, and is capable of rocking on or in water to harvest wave energy; it provides an innovative and effective approach toward large-scale blue energy harvesting of oceans and lakes. A freestanding-structured, fully enclosed triboelectric nanogenerator is designed with unique advantages for harvesting wave energy. When resonated with water waves, such a triboelectric nanogenerator can light up 70 LEDs instantaneously. Integrated with electric double-layer supercapacitors, such a system can power a digital thermometer in a duty cycle of 26.5%, showing its potential application in harvesting blue energy. &copy; 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Abstract:Reservoir Computing is a bio-inspired computing paradigm for processing time dependent signals. Its analog implementations equal and sometimes outperform other digital algorithms on a series of benchmark tasks. Their performance can be increased by switching from offline to online training method. Here we present the first online trained optoelectronic reservoir computer. The system is tested on a channel equalization task and the algorithm is executed by an FPGA chip. We report performances close to previous implementations and demonstrate the benefits of online training on a non-stationary task that could not be easily solved using offline methods. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Abstract:A continuous germanene layer grown on the Al (111) surface has recently been achieved in experiment. In this work, we investigate its structural, electronic, and hydrogenation-induced properties through first-principles calculations. We find that despite having a different lattice structure from its free-standing form, germanene on Al (111) still possesses Dirac points at high-symmetry K and K&prime; points. More importantly, there exist another three pairs of Dirac points on the K(K&prime;)-M high-symmetry lines, which have highly anisotropic dispersions due to the reduced symmetry. These massless Dirac Fermions become massive when spin-orbit coupling is included. Hydrogenation of the germanene layer strongly affects its structural and electronic properties. Particularly, when not fully hydrogenated, ferromagnetism can be induced due to unpaired local orbitals from the unsaturated Ge atoms. Remarkably, we discover that the one-side semihydrogenated germanene turns out to be a two-dimensional half-semimetal, representing a novel state of matter that is simultaneously a half-metal and a semimetal. &copy; 2015 American Chemical Society.

Abstract:This work examines the problem of using finite Gaussian mixtures (GMs) in Bayesian message passing algorithms for decentralized data fusion (DDF). It is shown that both exact and conservative GM DDF lead to the same problem of finding a suitable GM approximation to a posterior fusion pdf that results from the division of a 'naive Bayes' fusion GM (representing direct combination of possibly dependent information sources) by another non-Gaussian pdf (representing either the actual or estimated 'common information' of the information sources). It is shown that the resulting quotient pdf for general GM fusion is in fact naturally a mixture model pdf, although the fused mixands are non-Gaussian. Parallelizable importance sampling algorithms are proposed to find tractable Gaussian approximations to these non-Gaussian mixtures, leading to GM fusion approximations that are shown to be more robust and accurate than previously proposed techniques. &copy; 2015 IEEE.

Abstract:A current induced by electron spin resonance (ESR) transitions is investigated for polymer diodes using electrically detected magnetic resonance techniques. Polymer diodes under photoexcitation are shown to exhibit a strong ESR-induced current. The ESR current exhibits a spiked time response for modulation of the resonance condition and is concluded to result from a displacement current. The magnitude of the displacement current is found to vary depending on polymers used for active layers. Trapping and de-trapping processes of carriers are expected to determine the time profile of the displacement current, suggesting that materials with shallow trap levels would be suitable for applications to spin-based devices. &copy; 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Abstract:This paper identifies the main criteria used by architecture specialists in the task of clustering alternative floor plan designs. It shows how collective actions of respondents lead to their clustering by carrying out an online exercise. The designs were randomly pre-generated by a hybrid evolutionary algorithm and a questionnaire was posed in the end for the respondents to indicate which similarity criteria they have used. A network of designs was then obtained and it was partitioned into clusters using a modularity optimization algorithm. The results show that the main criterion used was the internal arrangement of spaces, followed by overall shape and by external openings orientation. This work allows the future development of novel algorithms for automatic classification, clustering, and database retrieval of architectural floor plans. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Abstract:The accuracy of visual measurement depends on a variety of factors, including the image discretization error, the used distortion model, feature detection error, the image resolution as well as the relative pose between the object and the camera. Although many reports are available on visual measurement applications, a systematical investigation of the above factors via simulation on the measurement precision is unavailable in the literature to our knowledge. This work is to give a systematical simulation and analysis of the above factors on the measurement accuracy. The simulation results show that the appropriate distortion model selection is the most important factor. When the image resolution is high, the effect of image discretization error is negligible. In contrast, image feature detection error could severely affect the accuracy of the estimated distortion parameters, which in turn affect the accuracy of the visual measurement. More specifically, for a 30 m&times;30 m planar object, it appears impossible to obtain an absolute measurement accuracy of 10 mm when the image resolution is of 2500&times;2500 pixels and the feature location error is less than one pixel. The above results could be of reference to both researchers and practitioners in the field. &copy; 2015, Institute of Computing Technology. All right reserved.

Abstract:This paper focuses on proposing a tangent prediction NURBS interpolator (TP) method for reducing the machining time and improving the surface quality, which adopts predicted tangent vectors to constrain the curve shape and suppress the curve fluctuation. Although the traditional NURBS path interpolation methods have the advantageous in flexibility and can be easily implemented, those methods tend to curve distortion if insufficient interpolation points or constraints are given, which will extend the curve length and influence the accuracy of the constructed module. In this paper, the geometric module constructed by the TP method can not only ensure a smooth transition between curve sections but also decrease the curve distortion. With the proposed method, the curvature radii at some local areas may increase, which means the chord error will increase accordingly. To minimize the chord error, a curve subsection process along with a 7-segment S-shape acceleration/deceleration (ACC/DEC) process are adopted here. Meanwhile, the predictor-corrector interpolator method is applied to reduce the velocity variation and improve the accuracy of the control system. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate the ability of the method by virtue of reducing the machining time and improving the surface quality. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Abstract:In this paper, we study the version history of eight databases that are part of larger open source projects, and report on our observations on how evolution-related properties, like the possibility of deletion, or the amount of updates that a table undergoes, are related to observable table properties like the number of attributes or the time of birth of a table. Our findings indicate that (i) most tables live quiet lives; (ii) few top-changers adhere to a profile of long duration, early birth, medium schema size at birth; (iii) tables with large schemata or long duration are quite unlikely to be removed, and, (iv) early periods of the database life demonstrate a higher level of evolutionary activity compared to later ones. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Abstract:Product line (PL) engineering promotes the development of families of related products, where individual products are differentiated by which optional features they include. Modelling and analyzing requirements models of PLs allows for early detection and correction of requirements errors - including unintended feature interactions, which are a serious problem in feature-rich systems. A key challenge in analyzing PL requirements is the efficient verification of the product family, given that the number of products is too large to be verified one at a time. Recently, it has been shown how the high-level design of an entire PL, that includes all possible products, can be compactly represented as a single model in the SMV language, and model checked using the NuSMV tool. The implementation in NuSMV uses BDDs, a method that has been outperformed by SAT-based algorithms. In this paper we develop PL model checking using two leading SAT-based symbolic model checking algorithms: IMC and IC3. We describe the algorithms, prove their correctness, and report on our implementation. Evaluating our methods on three PL models from the literature, we demonstrate an improvement of up to 3 orders of magnitude over the existing BDD-based method. &copy; 2015 IEEE.

Abstract:The NASA initiative to collect an asteroid, the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission (ARRM), is currently investigating the option of retrieving a boulder from an asteroid, demonstrating planetary defense with an enhanced gravity tractor technique, and returning it to a lunar orbit. Techniques for accomplishing this are being investigated by the Satellite Servicing Capabilities Office (SSCO) at NASA GSFC in collaboration with JPL, NASA JSC, LaRC, and Draper Laboratory, Inc. Two critical phases of the mission are the descent to the boulder and the Enhanced Gravity Tractor demonstration. A linear covariance analysis is done for these phases to assess the feasibility of these concepts with the proposed design of the sensor and actuator suite of the Asteroid Redirect Vehicle (ARV). The sensor suite for this analysis includes a wide field of view camera, LiDAR, and an IMU. The proposed asteroid of interest is currently the C-type asteroid 2008 EV5, a carbonaceous chondrite that is of high interest to the scientific community. This paper presents an overview of the linear covariance analysis techniques and simulation tool, provides sensor and actuator models, and addresses the feasibility of descending to the surface of the asteroid within allocated requirements as well as the possibility of maintaining a halo orbit to demonstrate the Enhanced Gravity Tractor technique.

Abstract:In this paper, the Second Harmonic light intensity scattered off a liquid solution upon illumination by an incident fundamental frequency beam is written within a general framework in order to describe its coherent and incoherent contributions. It is shown that this formulation requires the introduction of a correlation function in time, position and orientation. We discuss this framework in light of recent experiments where the interface and the bulk of liquid solutions can be investigated simultaneously. We apply here this analysis to a neat water solution to compare the bulk volume and the interface correlation functions. &copy; 2015 SPIE.

Abstract:Flat transmissive lens designs for infrared sensor applications based on sub-wavelength gratings were analyzed using a finite difference time domain program (Lumerical). An initial design for broadband transmission with a design wavelength of 4&mu;m exhibited a drop in the transmittance for large incidence angles that caused defocusing. This was investigated numerically and a phenomenological explanation is presented. The sub- wavelength structure was then optimized to work also for large incidence angles. The focal spot of the proposed lens was characterized using a finite element method package (Comsol). Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only. &copy; 2015 SPIE.

Abstract:This paper proposes a novel optimization of bounded model checking (BMC) for better run-time efficiency. Specifically, we define projections, an adaptation of dynamic program slices, and instruct the bounded model checker to check projections only. Given state properties over a subset of the program&rsquo;s variables, we prove the soundness of the proposed optimization. We propose a symbolic encoding of projections and implement it for a prototype language of concurrent programs. We have developed a tool called PBMC to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach. Our evaluation with various concurrent programs justifies the potential of projections to efficient verification. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Abstract:Halting cancer progression by altering the tumor microenvironment is an exciting new frontier in oncology. One target for new therapies is the structural support provided by the extracellular matrix, which for cancer cells is often abnormal and undergoes drastic modification during angiogenesis, tumor proliferation, and metastasis. We have developed a new magnetic nanoparticle-based agent, Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-PEG-EDDA (EDDA: (Z)-octa-4-en-2,6-diyne-1,8-diamine), that is capable of generating radicals via Bergman cyclization of the pendant enediyne during mild hyperthermia treatment using an alternating magnetic field. We observe formation of a cyclized aromatic product in the Raman spectra of the thermally excited material and can detect polymeric product after periods of induction. When mixed with the basement membrane extract Matrigel, the nanoparticles do not interfere with normal biopolymer network formation. Applying the same hyperthermia conditions as in solution samples, Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-PEG-EDDA causes structural collapse of the matrix, visible by electron microscopy, in contrast to the nonradical-forming thermal control Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-PEG-BD (BD: o-xylylenediamine). Localized damage to the extracellular matrix by nanoparticle-induced molecular transformations represent a conceptual new tool in tumor microenvironment modification. &copy; 2015 American Chemical Society.

Abstract:New chemical pathways are of fundamental interest for materials synthesis. Here, we report a novel surfactant-free, solution-phase, lowerature route to crystalline, ultrasmall (2 nm) Cu<inf>3</inf>N nanoparticles via a one-step reaction between copper(II) methoxide and benzylamine. We propose a reaction mechanism for Cu<inf>3</inf>N formation based on the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the organic reaction byproducts. The reaction pathway involves reduction of the Cu(II) to Cu(I) by benzylamine, in situ generation of ammonia, and finally, the reaction between Cu(I) and ammonia to form Cu<inf>3</inf>N. We tested the Cu<inf>3</inf>N nanoparticles as an anode material for Li-ion batteries (LIBs). According to cyclic voltammetry, the Cu<inf>3</inf>N nanoparticles quickly undergo a phase transformation to Cu<inf>2</inf>O, but then stably deliver a capacity of 290 mAh/g at 1 A/g in the following 150 cycles. &copy; 2015 American Chemical Society.

Abstract:Small-body landing missions present difficult challenges to Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) systems. A typical mission profile makes a distinction between a mapping phase and a terminal navigation phase. In the mapping phase, analysts on the ground process spacecraft sensor data to generate a geometric and visual model of the body. This model is used to pick a particular landing site. Then during the terminal navigation stage, the spacecraft must autonomously drive itself towards the landing site using the map. There are two major hurdles here. The first hurdle is that the visual appearance of the map will change as the direction to the sun changes in both the body-frame and the sensor-frame. The second hurdle is that smaller landing hazards on the ground only become visible due to improved spatial resolution as the spacecraft gets closer to the surface and are therefore not a part of the map made from greater standoff range. This paper presents a method to clear both of these hurdles. An algorithm to sequentially estimate the full geometry and texture of the local terrain about the landing site is developed. With this information and an estimate of sensor-to-inertial and body-to-inertial pose available, the terrain is efficiently rendered under the actual lighting and estimated relative sensor pose conditions. The rendered images are then compared to sensor images to perform pose estimate updates. Details of the map parameterization, rendering algorithm, pose estimation method, and filtering are presented. Laboratory experiments in a simulated scene with ground truth data are used to validate the algorithm. Copyright &copy; 2015 California Institute of Technology.

Abstract:Mobile malware attempts to evade detection during app analysis by mimicking security-sensitive behaviors of benign apps that provide similar functionality (e.g., sending SMS messages), and suppressing their payload to reduce the chance of being observed (e.g., executing only its payload at night). Since current approaches focus their analyses on the types of securitysensitive resources being accessed (e.g., network), these evasive techniques in malware make differentiating between malicious and benign app behaviors a difficult task during app analysis. We propose that the malicious and benign behaviors within apps can be differentiated based on the contexts that trigger securitysensitive behaviors, i.e., the events and conditions that cause the security-sensitive behaviors to occur. In this work, we introduce AppContext, an approach of static program analysis that extracts the contexts of security-sensitive behaviors to assist app analysis in differentiating between malicious and benign behaviors. We implement a prototype of AppContext and evaluate AppContext on 202 malicious apps from various malware datasets, and 633 benign apps from the Google Play Store. AppContext correctly identifies 192 malicious apps with 87.7% precision and 95% recall. Our evaluation results suggest that the maliciousness of a security-sensitive behavior is more closely related to the intention of the behavior (reflected via contexts) than the type of the security-sensitive resources that the behavior accesses. &copy; 2015 IEEE.

Abstract:The use of fungicides was a common practice to control fruit decay. Nowadays, other environment friendly technologies are required, such as heat treatments. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of hydrothermal treatments (traditional and microwave assisted) in Fremont and Thomas mandarins (Citrus reticulata Blanco). The treatment conditions were to reach 50&deg;C and held during 2.5 min, followed by hydro-cooling at 9&deg;C during 30 min. The treatments did not affect pH and total soluble solids (TSS) in fruits (p&gt;0.05). Furthermore, titratable acidity and ascorbic acid content were not affected in both varieties of mandarins by the use of microwave-assisted treatment. Microwave-assisted treatments have potential to retain the nutritional and physico-chemical characteristics of mandarins, being faster than the traditional method.

Abstract:The fundamental capability of Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) is game changing for space exploration. A first generation NTP system could provide high thrust at a specific impulse above 900 s, roughly double that of state of the art chemical engines. Characteristics of fission and NTP indicate that useful first generation systems will provide a foundation for future systems with extremely high performance. The role of a first generation NTP in the development of advanced nuclear propulsion systems could be analogous to the role of the DC-3 in the development of advanced aviation. Progress made under the NTP project could also help enable high performance fission power systems and Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP). Guidance, navigation, and control of NTP may have some unique but manageable Characteristics. Copyright &copy; 2015 California Institute of Technology.

Abstract:In recent years, deep learning has attracted much interest for addressing complex AI tasks. However, most of the deep learning models need to be trained for a long time in order to obtain good results. To overcome this problem, the deep convolutional activation feature (DeCAF) was proposed, which is directly extracted from the activation of a well trained deep convolutional neural network. Nevertheless, the dimensionality of DeCAF is simply fixed to a constant number. In this case, one may ask whether DeCAF is good enough for image classification applications and whether we can further improve its performance? To answer these two questions, we propose a new model called RS-DeCAF based on &ldquo;reducing&rdquo; and &ldquo;stretching&rdquo; the dimensionality of DeCAF. In the implementation of RS-DeCAF, we reduce the dimensionality of DeCAF using dimensionality reduction methods, such as PCA, and meanwhile increase the dimensionality by stretching the weight matrix between successive layers. RS-DeCAF is aimed to discover the effective representations of data for classification tasks. As there is no back propagation is needed for network training, RS-DeCAF is very efficient and can be easily applied to large scale problems. Extensive experiments on image classification show that RS-DeCAF not only slightly im proves DeCAF, but dramatically outperforms previous &ldquo;stretching&rdquo; and other state-ofthe-art approaches. Hence, RS-DeCAF can be considered as an effective substitute for previous DeCAF and &ldquo;stretching&rdquo; approaches. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Abstract:Internet real-name registration requires a user to provide personal identification credentials including his/her real name to an online service provider when registering for an account. In China, real-name registration has been implemented since 2010 for purchasing train tickets and mobile phone SIM cards. In 2013, the Chinese government announced that real-name registration would be implemented for Internet users to protect against cyber crimes, including cyber bullying, rumor spreading and identity theft. When real-name registration is in place, law enforcement agencies can obtain the real identity of a user who attempts to leverage the anonymity provided by the Internet to conduct criminal activities. However, real-name registration also potentially infringes on online privacy. This chapter presents a privacy-preserving Internet real-name registration approach based on Shamir&rsquo;s secret sharing scheme. The approach helps protect the identities of online users while enabling law enforcement to obtain the identities of users involved in criminal activities on the Internet. &copy; IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.

Abstract:Gold nanoclusters hold many potential applications such as biosensing and optics due to their emission characteristics, small size, and non-toxicity. However, their low quantum yields remain problematic for further applications, and their fluorescence mechanism is still unclear. To increase the low quantum yields, various methods have been performed: doping, tuning structures, and changing number of gold atoms. In the past, most characterizations have been performed on spherical shaped nanoclusters; in this paper, several characterizations of various rod-shaped Au nanoclusters specifically on Au<inf>25</inf>are shown. It has been determined that the central gold atom in Au<inf>25</inf>nano-rod is crucial in fluorescence. Furthermore, single molecule analysis of silver doped Au<inf>25</inf>nano-rod revealed that it has more photo-stability than conjugated polymers and quantum dots. &copy; 2015 SPIE.

Abstract:This work aims to investigate the infiltration of a CaCO<inf>3</inf>filled resin in fibrous porous media (resin transfer molding process) using the PAM-RTM software. A preform of glass fiber mat (fraction 30%), with dimensions 320 &times; 150 &times; 3.6 mm, has been used in rectilinear injection experiments conducted at room temperature and injection pressure 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 bar. The polyester resin contain 0% and 40% CaCO<inf>3</inf>. The numerical results were evaluated by direct comparison with experimental data. The flat flow-front profile of the rectilinear flow was reached approximately half length of the mold. It was observed, that the both velocity infiltration and permeability have decreased with increasing the CaCO<inf>3</inf>content, thus, increasing the time to processing of the composite material. &copy; (2015) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

Abstract:With the emergence of a memristor, a new opportunity has been brought for the further development of electronic information technology. In this study, the memristors are applied separately to a hysteretic comparator and arithmetic circuit based on self-contraction memristor hysteretic behaviour analysis. Furthermore, the performance of a memristor in the circuit is deduced by theoretical analysis. It shows that the memristor with non-linear characteristics can replace ordinary resistors to achieve the movement of a hysteretic comparator&rsquo;s characteristic curve and change a linear operation circuit into a non-linear operation circuit. It would provide an example for analysis of the new functions that the memristor produces in electronic circuits. &copy; 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

Abstract:Process control algorithms constitute a specific software model, as they have well-defined and constant sets of inputs and outputs, and perform calculations cyclically in real time. Therefore, the algorithms rarely are implemented otherwise than embedded in the low level control instrumentation. This paper proposes a departure from this well-known approach in order to apply multiagent system directly in the control layer. While this novel approach creates few issues requiring resolving, such as the need to develop an agent-based software operating in real time, it also provides the crucial benefit i.e. the possibility of developing the modules of the control algorithm by experts from different fields, which allows for cooperative dynamic engineering of a control algorithm. The resulting methodology allows to include more modern and advanced solutions from various fields of control science than it is possible in the case of the classical approach. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Abstract:The Florida avocado industry is the state's second-largest fruit industry (behind citrus) with 30, 700 tons of avocado harvested in 2013 and a value of the production of $35 million at the wholesale level. Laurel wilt (LW) is a vascular disease that has recently spread rapidly along the southeastern seaboard of the United States. LW disease has the potential to quickly destroy avocado production in Florida causing losses of $27 to 54 million if a reliable control strategy is not found. In this study, the spatial requirements necessary to discriminate LW from healthy trees were evaluated. A MCA-6 Tetracam camera was used to take images in an LW infected avocado orchard with trees at different stages of LW development: early, intermediate, and late at three helicopter flying altitudes (180, 250 and 300 m). The most effective flight altitude, as well as vegetation indices were selected by performing analysis of variance (ANOVA) and M-statistic to quantify the separability between classes. These results confirmed the potential of classifying LW at different stages of development, even trees in the early stage of disease development with minimal symptoms, using multispectral aerial images captured by a MCA-6 camera.

Abstract:In this study, a first-principles investigation of hydrogen storage in the FeTi intermetallic is carried out. The structural and electronic changes due to hydrogen insertion into the FeTi intermetallic are determined using DFT and pseudo-potential calculations through the code SIESTA (Spanish Initiative for Electronic Simulation of Thousand of Atoms). The pseudopotentials are constructed using Troullier and Martins parametrization which describes correctly the ion-electron interactions. To define the real-space grid, necessary for numerical calculations of the electron density, detailed tests were performed in order to choose the appropriate basis set, the energy cutoff and the k-grid cutoff. The exchange-correlation potential is treated with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Lattice data, bonding properties and the density of states provide an explanation for the role played by hydrogen in the chemical bond with the Ti and Fe constituents. &copy; (2015) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

Abstract:The electronic structures of the CdMoO<inf>4</inf>:W<sup>6+</sup>crystal were studied in density function theory (DFT), using the embedded-cluster discrete variational method.

Abstract:The research reported in this paper determined the effect of combined microwave irradiation and NaOH pretreatment on solubilization and biodegradation in anaerobic digestion of waste-activated sludge (WAS). Solubilization increased significantly with NaOH concentration (20-60 meqNaOH/L) and microwave final temperature (100-170&deg;C). However, the experimental trials did not adequately approximate the response surface for volatile solids reduction, cumulative biogas production, and biogas yield. Within the design boundaries, the maximum solubilization degree (72%) of WAS occurred at 60 meq/L and 170&deg;C. The highest volatile solids removal efficiency (62.4%) was achieved at 40 meq/L and 170&deg;C. Cumulative biogas production and yield were 2.3-5.7 L/L and 154-393 mL/g added volatile solids, respectively, and both parameters were highest at 20 meq/L and 135&deg;C. &copy; 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Abstract:Although text-mining, sentiment analysis, and other forms of analysis have been carried out on financial investment applications, a significant amount of associated research is ad hoc searching for meaningful patterns. Other research in finance develops theory using limited data sets. These efforts are at two extremes. To bridge the gap between financial data analytics and finance domain theory, this research analyzes a specific conceptual model, the Business Intelligence Model (BIM), to identify constructs and concepts that could be beneficial for matching data analytics to domain theory. Doing so, provides a first step towards understanding how to effectively generate and validate domain theories that significantly benefit from data analytics. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Abstract:This paper proposes a real-time road region detection method for safe driving assistance systems. This is a method on detecting road regions by receiving input images from vehicle black boxes. As such, we propose a method that detects major straight line components through Hough transform in input images, selects a vanishing point from the intersection of detected straight lines using preliminary information from the road environment, and detects road regions using the selected vanishing point and left and right straight lines from the Hough transform. As a result of applying the proposed method to various road environments, approximately 0.37 s were consumed per frame, providing over 81% detection accuracy. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Abstract:Micropatterns of hydrophilic polymer brushes were prepared by micromolding in capillaries (MIMIC). The polymers are covalently bound to the surfaces by a rapid hetero Diels-Alder reaction, constituting the first example of polymers grafted to surfaces in a defined pattern by MIMIC. The polymers [poly(acrylic acid), poly(hydroxyethyl acrylate), and poly(tetraethylene glycol acrylate) ranging in molecular weight from 1500 to 6000 g mol<sup>-1</sup>] were prepared with narrow dispersities via the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) process using a highly electron deficient RAFT agent that can react with surface-anchored dienes such as cyclopentadiene. We demonstrate that the anchoring method is facile to perform and highly suitable for preparing patterned surfaces that are passivated against biological impact in well-defined areas. &copy; 2015 American Chemical Society.

Abstract:The diffusion of singlet and triplet excitons along single polyfluorene chains in solution has been studied by monitoring their transport to end traps. Time-resolved transient absorption and steady state fluorescence were used to determine fractions of excitons that reach the end caps. In order to accurately determine the singlet diffusion coefficient, the fraction of polymer ends that have end traps was determined through a combination of NMR and triplet quenching experiments. The distributions of polymer lengths were also taken into account and the resulting analysis points to a surprisingly long singlet diffusion length of 34 nm. Experiments on triplet transport also suggest that the entire 100nm+ chain is accessible to the triplet during its lifetime suggesting a lack of hindrance by defects or traps on this timescale. Time Resolved Microwave Conductivity measurements were also performed on a series of different length oligo- and polyfluorenes in solution allowing a global fit to be performed to extract an accurate intrachain mobility of 1.1 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs. &copy; 2015 SPIE.

Abstract:In foundry liquid glass that used as a binder for foundry molds and cores is one of the most accessible, cheap and non-toxic binders. Liquid glass mixture was allowed to obtain the necessary physic-mechanical and technological properties, but it has hindered removal from castings. The removal of mixtures can be improved by reducing the number of liquid glass in the mixture, or by introducing new processing aids, but in this case the properties of the mixture significantly changed. That is why in the development of process is necessary to select the optimal composition of the mixture to produce quality castings at the lowest cost. Obtaining of a mixture for the foundry industry with the optimal properties is a complex multi-criteria problem which was solved by the theory of qualities. This let significantly reduce the duration of the experiment. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Abstract:We present a fully atomistic simulation study of a filler-to-filler contact embedded in a polymer matrix. The system consists of two silica spheres embedded in polyisoprene. Tests are presented showing that our polymerization algorithm achieves the proper polymer density and characteristic ratio. In this study, the polymer chains are not chemically attached to the particle surfaces and neither are they chemically cross-linked. We apply an external force in the direction of the axis of the system to one of the silica particles and determine the attendant distance to the second particle. The force-distance curves confirm a previously suggested loss mechanism, allowing us to estimate the dissipated energy when a contact is opened and closed due to cyclic loading. We also study the atomic structure and mobility inside the polymer close to the particle surfaces. We do find structural ordering in terms of three appreciable density peaks. The atom mobility inside these density shells is characterized by a fast and a slow process. The latter shows an apparent dependence on the shell's distance from the particle surface. &copy; 2015 American Chemical Society.

Abstract:Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene), (rr-P3HT), is widely regarded as an archetypical semiconducting electron-donor polymer in bulk heterojunction solar cells, mainly due to its notable exciton and charge transport properties. Conversely, its use in photonic/lighting devices received little interest owing to its low emission quantum yield in the solid state, related to its large tendency to self-organize into lamellar domains with highly nonemissive character. We present experimental evidence pointing to a large miscibility of P3HT in poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT), accompanied by mutual &pi;-&pi; interactions. Concomitant to this effect, the emission properties of P3HT:F8BT blends, which are attributed to heterogeneous interchain complexes, experience a significant improvement, with photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) values approaching 25% (almost a 7-fold efficiency enhancement with respect to neat/aggregated rr-P3HT). Our results open up new prospects for improved photonic properties through appropriate control of interchain interactions. &copy; 2015 American Chemical Society.

Abstract:Exploration beyond low Earth orbit continues to be a key goal for many space programs today. For these missions it is becoming increasingly necessary to utilize optical techniques for navigation. While a variety of optical navigation (OPNAV) measurement types are available, the centroid and apparent diameter method is an interesting technique that has received considerable attention in recent years by various authors. Prior work, however, has mostly focused on state estimation, with only limited consideration given to the estimate covariance. The present paper addresses this knowledge gap by providing a detailed treatment of the error sources that influence the quality of a centroid and apparent diameter OPNAV measurement. The work begins with a careful examination of potential image processing algorithms for autonomously extracting points along the Moon's (or Earth's) limb in an image. These algorithms are assessed for both their robustness to various illumination conditions and the noise/bias of the estimated limb locations. With the statistics of the limb finding processes in hand, attention is turned to understanding how errors inherent in image formation and processing propagate through the projective geometry and nonlinear estimation routines used to compute the spacecraft position. The theories developed here are validated by processing both simulated and real images, and results are shown. Copyright &copy; 2015 California Institute of Technology.

Abstract:Neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) are a group of heterogeneous diseases that show differences in incidence, hereditary, etiology, prognosis, or functional impairments. Wheelchair use (manual or powered) is influenced by several factors, including personal and contextual factors, and comprehensive evaluation of their impact is required in order to optimize prescription and provision of wheelchairs. The authors therefore assessed the influence of wheelchair use on the quality of life (QoL) of 60 participants with NMD using the Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Devices Scale (PIADS). The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and a specially developed questionnaire were used to obtain information about contextual factors and participants activity profile of activities of the participants. The results showed that using a wheelchair has psychosocial benefits, with the main determinants of benefit being type of wheelchair (powered), non-ambulation ability, and independence in mobility. Ensuring a good match between user and assistive technology (AT; e.g., wheelchair), as well as the effectiveness of the particular device, will increase the likelihood that the user will adopt it and use it effectively in daily life. Clinical prescription of AT would be improved by making appropriate use of outcome measures. Copyright &copy; 2015 RESNA.

Abstract:The doping effect of a new dopant to BiOCl as photocatalyst is studied. SnS<inf>2</inf>as a narrow-band-gap semiconductor is used to tune the electronic and band structure of wide-band-gap BiOCl. BiOCl/SnS<inf>2</inf>hollow spheres are synthesized by a facile and economic one-pot hydrothermal method. The shell of the hollow spheres is composed by BiOCl and SnS<inf>2</inf>, but the outermost layer is BiOCl. BiOCl/SnS<inf>2</inf>hollow spheres exhibit much higher photocatalytic activity than pure SnS<inf>2</inf>and BiOCl in the degradation of rhodamine-B under visible light and sun-light irradiation. The improvement is explained by the band structure tuning effect by SnS<inf>2</inf>and the morphological benefits of the hollow sphere structure. &copy; The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.

Abstract:Lignocellulosic materials sustainability in ethanol production could be supported by the use of mixed raw materials. Therefore the effect of mixed raw materials to hydrolysis kinetics needs to be studied. For this purpose each raw material was hydrolyzed and the mixed raw materials were also hydrolyzed. As a result, a comparison of the kinetics models of dilute sulfuric acid hydrolysis between various lignocellulosic materials (leaf, twig, corn cob, sawdust) and its mixture was obtained. It was observed that a pseudo-homogeneous model can quantitatively describe individual materials as well as mixed materials with different levels of accuracy. Besides the kinetics model, the influence of various lignocellulosic materials on sugar yield was also investigated. The results showed that the lignin content of the raw material influenced the sugar yield of the hydrolysis. Moreover the mixed lignocellulosic materials did not proportionally provide a yield based on its composition. Some hydrolyzates were fermented to verify whether the sugars formed could be converted into ethanol using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The fermentation results showed that high sugar concentrations of hydrolyzates did not produce high ethanol yields. The various sugar types and the chemical substance of the sugar degradation affected the ethanol yield from sugars. &copy; 2015 Taylor & Francis.

Abstract:A (build) target specifies the information that is needed to automatically build a software artifact. This paper focuses on underutilized targets-an important dependency prob- lem that we identified at Google. An underutilized target is one with files not needed by some of its dependents. Underutilized targets result in less modular code, overly large artifacts, slow builds, and unnecessary build and test triggers. To mitigate these problems, programmers decompose underutilized targets into smaller targets. However, manually decomposing a target is tedious and error-prone. Although we prove that finding the best target decomposition is NP-hard, we introduce a greedy algorithm that proposes a decomposition through iterative unification of the strongly connected components of the target. Our tool found that 19,994 of 40,000 Java library targets at Google can be decomposed to at least two targets. The results show that our tool is (1) efficient because it analyzes a target in two minutes on average and (2) effective because for each of 1,010 targets, it would save at least 50% of the total execution time of the tests triggered by the target. &copy; 2015 IEEE.

Abstract:Filler preflocculation using carbohydrate polymer imparts good bondability to cellulosic fibres, and improves inter-fibre bonding and paper strength. The present paper throws light upon the role of amphoteric starch on composite tensile index (CTI) of paper, and filler bondability factor (FBF) calculated using ash content and first pass ash retention, and various tensile strengths of paper viz., tensile strength, Z-direction tensile strength (ZDTS) and CTI. The cooked amphoteric starch (0.1 to 0.8% on dry weight of filler) was mixed with talc filler at controlled conditions for getting the preflocculated filler. The resultant preflocculated filler was added to pulp slurry to get varying ash content of 15 to 24% in laboratory sheets of 60 gsm. The FPAR, tensile strength and ZDTS of paper sheets were measured and analysed. CTI was calculated from the results of tensile strength and ZDTS. Statistical model equations were also developed for the prediction of CTI and FBF. Paper strength and FBF reduced on increasing paper ash whereas those were protected to some extent through loading of preflocculated filler. Noticeably, CTI and FBFCTI increased through filler preflocculation up to 26% and 38%, respectively at 24% paper ash.

Abstract:Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) multilayer (ML) technology has been intensively applied in many scientific and technological fields such as solar physics and photolithography. More recently, the advent of free electron lasers (FEL) emitting bright sub-ps pulses with very high quality in term of intensity stability, coherence and temporal shape has encouraged the usage of multilayer coatings also in the transport and manipulation of FEL radiation. In fact, conventional single layers coated mirrors provide negligible reflectance in the EUV spectral range whereas ML mirrors can reach high efficiency at normal incidence without affecting the pulses characteristics. Such optical elements have been also exploited at FERMI@ELETTRA FEL where novel multilayer coatings specifically conceived for pump and probe experiment and ultrafast absorption spectroscopy have been designed. The main results are reported. &copy; 2015 SPIE.

Abstract:Defining a link between wind-tunnel settling chamber screens, flow quality and test section boundary-layer spanwise variation is necessary for accurate transition prediction. The aim of this work is to begin establishing this link. The computed, steady, laminar wake of a zither (screen model) with imperfect wire spacing is tracked through a contraction and into a model test section. The contraction converts the zither wake into streamwise vorticity which then creates spanwise variation (streaks) in the test-section boundary layer. The magnitude of the spanwise variation is sensitive to the zither open-area ratio and imperfections, but the observed wavelength is relatively insensitive to the zither wire spacing. Increased spanwise variation is attributed to large wavelength variation of drag across the zither, and not the coalescence of jets phenomena. The linear stability of the streaks is predicted using the parabolized stability equations with the method. A standard deviation of zither wire position error of 38.1 m (15 % of wire diameter) for a zither of 50 % open-area ratio is found to suppress Tollmien-Schlichting wave growth significantly. &copy; 2015 Cambridge University Press.

Abstract:In this paper we propose a cloud model of internet of things for logistic supply chains. In the cloud model, the cloud terminals can collect, receive and deliver information by integration of mobile networks, wireless networks, networks of sensors, including data, video and audio information. The data and information are classified and dealt with in the cloud service platform where the communication cluster servers, application servers, middleware servers and database servers are located. In this model the cluster service, resource dispatch and load balance are cooperative for every application group in the cloud in order to serve for the management and monitoring during the logistic supply chain lifecycle. In order to support high performance of cloud service, NIO (Non-blocking Input/Output) and RMI (Remote Method Invocation) are applied for the resource cooperative dispatch. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Abstract:An energy efficient resource allocation algorithm for downlink multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiple (MIMO-OFDM) system was proposed to implement the energy efficiency (EE) maximization, satisfying total power constraint as well as the proportional rate constraints. In order to reduce the computational complexity, a two-step subcarrier assignment and power allocation scheme was proposed to derive the suboptimal solution of the optimization problem. The estimated energy-efficient transmit power is obtained under assumption of flat fading and subcarrier sharing. The equal-power allocation-based method was adopted to carry out subcarrier assignment. Furthermore, the optimal energy-efficient power allocation was derived according to the result of the first-step subcarrier assignment. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm brings remarkable gains on energy efficiency and guarantees proportional fairness of the users. &copy; 2015, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

Abstract:In this paper, we show how adaptive modeling within the statistical parametric speech synthesis framework can be applied to Albanian dialects. We develop speaker dependent voices for the Tosk and Gheg dialect and adapt models for the Gheg dialect from the Tosk models. We show that the adapted Gheg models outperform the speaker dependent Gheg model on an intelligibility and dialect classification task. Furthermore we show that the speaker dependent Tosk model outperforms a formant based synthesizer on an intelligibility, dialect classification and pair-wise comparison task. This formant based synthesizer is the only publicly available synthesizer for Albanian at the moment. We also show that our Gheg and Tosk synthesizers are as intelligible as natural speech. The method where one dialect is modeled through adaptation of a closely related other dialect can be applied to language varieties in general, where the background variety and adapted variety can be chosen based on pragmatic considerations like speaker or data resource availability. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Abstract:The electronic structure and optical properties of ZnO and Cd-doped ZnO were investigated by ultrasoft pseudopotential approach of the plane wave based on density functional theory (DFT). The results indicate that the cadmium dopant plays a vital role in fine tuning the electronic structure and optical properties. Via Cd-doping, the size of crystal increases and the energy gap decreases. The dielectric peak at 4.3 eV enhances and shifts to red, but the dielectric peak at 12.9 eV weakens. Also, the ultraviolet adsorption is enhanced by Cd doping. &copy; 2015, Chinese Ceramic Society. All right reserved.

Abstract:This paper proposes a cloud computing technique to apply to microclimate monitoring and environmental control applications in greenhouse. The use of cloud-based wireless network can reduce the wiring and cabling cost of wired network in greenhouse and easy to configure and adjust. The proposed system consists of main control modules, multiple sub-control modules and sensing modules, which collect the environmental parameters of each node in greenhouse and perform control decision based on fuzzy inference engine and expert knowledge database. The user can utilize the graphical user interface (GUI) or webpage application interface to setup the desired environment parameters (such as temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, and photo flux) of each zone and then send it to the sub-system via Zigbee module. The environmental control module of each sub-system will be performed to maintain the desired environment parameters setup by the user. The experiment is tested in semi-closed greenhouse which includes four cultivation zones. One subsystem and sensors are installed in each zone and the major system is placed outside the greenhouse. The proposed system is helpful for user to observe the variation of environment parameters of each cultivation zone remotely through GUI and webpage. Meanwhile, the regulation of environment parameters Is executed automatically through cloud computing. The proposed method can achieve a different manipulation of each cultivation zone for heterogeneous environments.

Abstract:Recent studies on remote detection methods were mostly for improving variables like sensing distance, sensitivity and power consumption. Especially using anisotropic magneto-resistive sensors with low power consumption and high sensitivity for detecting subsurface magnetic materials became very popular in last decades. In our study, for detecting subsurface materials, we have used fluxgate sensor network for having even higher sensitivity and also minimizing the power consumption by detecting the changing rates of horizontal component of earth's magnetic flux which is assumed to be very low. We have constituted a magnetic measurement system which comprises a detector system, which has a mechanism enables sensors to move in 3-D space, a data acquisition module for processing and sending all sensor information, and a computer for running the magnetic flux data evaluation and recording software. Using this system, tests are carried out to detect anomalies on horizontal component of earth's magnetic flux which is created by different subsurface materials with known magnetic, chemical and geometric properties. The harmonics of horizontal component of earth's magnetic flux in scanned area are analyzed by the help of DSP Lock-In amplifier and the amplitudes of high variation harmonics are shown as computer graphics. Using the graphic information, the upside surface geometry of subsurface material is defined. For identifying the magnetic anomalies, we have used the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT)-binary robust invariant scalable keypoints (BRISKs) as keypoint and descriptor. We used an algorithm for matching the newly scanned image to the closest image in database which is constituted of mines and possible other metal objects like cans, etc. Results show that, if the proposed detection system is used instead of metal detectors which cannot distinguish mines from other metal materials and alert for every type of metal with different geometries, it can be said that miss alarm count, work force and time can be decreased dramatically. In this paper, mostly the setup of the system is described and in Appendix A some experimental outputs of the system for different geometries of metal samples are given. And also for comparing the results of the proposed system, additional experiments are carried out with a different type of sensor chip, namely KMZ51, and also given in Appendix A. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:Based on the first-order shear deformation theory, the free vibration of the functionally graded (FG) truncated conical shells is analyzed. The truncated conical shell materials are assumed to be isotropic and inhomogeneous in the longitudinal direction. The two-constituent FG shell consists of ceramic and metal. These constituents are graded through the length, from one end of the shell to the other end. Using Hamilton's principle the derived governing equations are solved using differential quadrature method. Fast rate of convergence of this method is tested and its advantages over other existing solver methods are observed. The primary results of this study were obtained for four different end boundary conditions, and for some special cases, acquired results were compared with those available in the literature. Furthermore, effects of geometrical parameters, material graded power index, and boundary conditions on the natural frequencies of the FG truncated conical shell are carried out. &copy; 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Abstract:Excess water production is a common problem in mature and hydrocarbon rate declining oil and gas fields. Increased water production rates reduce oil and gas production, increase the cost related with fluid lifting, handling and disposal of produced water, and negatively influence the hydrocarbon production economics. Among the various existing techniques for water control, silicate gel systems are known to be an effective and environmentally friendly method for managing water production. The gel systems usually contain two main components, the liquid silica and activator. The low-viscosity (almost like water) system, which is mixed and pumped from surface in a liquid form, is designed to gel under reservoir conditions, thus allowing sufficient time for the pumped fluids to reach the designated location from the treatment well.This work focuses on the laboratory qualification of a commercially available sodium silicate system for designing and implementing field water shutoff treatments in mature, naturally-fractured carbonate formations. Lab rheology measurements are carried on sodium silicate gel samples using the Anton Paar Rheometer MCR302. Two test modes are run with the specific purposes: the Dynamic-Mechanical (DMA) mode is employed to determine the onset of gelation (sol-gel transition time or gel point) and the viscosity increase versus time; the Amplitude Sweep (AS) mode is used to assess the formed gel's shear strength at a given viscosity. Gel point and gel strength play an important role in designing successful water shutoff treatments since the first determines the required time for the injected gelant system to gel into reservoir and other determines the forces the formed gel can withstand under shear conditions.The effects of silicate and activator (NaCl solution) concentrations, presence of divalent ions (e.g., Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>), temperature, and gelant dilution on sol-gel transition time are investigated. A general correlation is derived that describes the relation between sol-gel transition times and silicate solution concentration, activator concentration, temperature, degree of water dilution, and concentration of divalent ions. This correlation can be used to design the recipe of the silicate system for applications in fields with treatment region temperatures in the range of 40-60&deg;. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:An extended element free Galerkin method (XEFGM) has been adopted for fracture analysis of functionally graded materials (FGMs). Orthotropic enrichments functions are used along with the sub-triangle technique for enhancing the Gauss quadrature accuracy near the crack, and the incompatible interaction integral method is employed to calculate the stress intensity factors. Numerical simulations have proved that XEFGM provides more accurate results by less number of nodes (DOFs) in comparison with the unenriched EFGM and other conventional methods for several FGM problems with different crack locations and loadings. The results have been compared with the reference results, showing the reliability, stability, and efficiency of present XEFGM.Received 9 June 2014 Accepted 17 September 2014. &copy; 2016 Taylor & Francis.

Abstract:Traffic sign retroreflectivity condition is one of the most critical factors impacting nighttime driving safety. The federal rule on minimum traffic sign retroreflectivity incorporated in the 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) issued by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is compelling transportation agencies to evaluate how to comply. As the traditional manual methods have become financially and/or practically infeasible, there is an urgent need for an effective and efficient retroreflectivity evaluation method. This paper investigates the possibility and proposes a methodology for automatically evaluating traffic sign retroreflectivity condition using mobile light detection and ranging (LIDAR) and computer vision. The proposed methodology uses (a) the traffic sign detection and color segmentation methods that are introduced for the first time to evaluate the retroreflectivity of different traffic sign colors separately in an automated manner; (b) the proposed theoretical-empirical LIDAR retro-intensity normalization scheme to more reliably model the radiometric responses of traffic sign captured in the mobile LIDAR data; (c) the population-based condition assessment method for the first time to statistically quantify the retroreflectivity condition of traffic signs rather than an four-point average. An experimental test was conducted on 35 Type I Engineer Grade stop signs. The result shows that the proposed methodology can produce a promising outcome with consistent retroreflectivity evaluations based on handheld retroreflectometer measurements; the proposed methodology can, also, better identify traffic signs with non-homogeneous deteriorated retroreflectivity. The reliable retroreflectivity evaluation results make the proposed methodology an appealing alternative for transportation agencies to use to comply with the FHWA's requirement. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:This study investigates the effect of customer orientation on innovation performance in manufacturing and service firms by comparing their innovation mechanisms. Based on a sample of 1646 manufacturing firms and 686 service firms, our results indicate that customer orientation positively affects service innovativeness and product innovativeness in service firms and manufacturing firms, respectively, and that such effects are mediated by two important firm resources: supplier collaboration and technological capability. However, customer orientation has a stronger total effect on innovativeness and supplier collaboration has a stronger mediating effect on the relationship between customer orientation and innovativeness in service firms. Although many previous studies have indicated that technological capability is relatively unimportant in service firms, our analyses indicate that it is now an equally important factor in service innovation and manufacturing innovation. These findings contribute to our understanding of innovation in the service and manufacturing industries, and to the literature on customer orientation, the resource-based view of the firm, and service-dominant logic. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:In the olive oil-producing countries, large quantities of olive solid waste are dumped in nature causing several environmental problems. Therefore, the use of this by-product as filler in (ethylene-propylene) matrix could be an effective way to reduce significantly the quantities of the disposed biomass and elaborate a cost-effective material. However, the hydrophilic nature of this natural filler decreases the compatibility with the hydrophobic matrix. To improve the interfacial adhesion, maleated polypropylene was added as a compatibilizing agent. In a first step, the influence of the filler loading on the rheological, thermal, and mechanical properties was investigated. Composites with various filler contents were prepared by melt blending using a twin-screw extruder and injection molding. The filler addition led to an increase of the viscoelastic properties and the crystallinity degree. Then, the coupling agent (MAPP) was reported to enhance the rheological, thermal, and mechanical properties of the composites up to a critical amount beyond which the plasticizing effect becomes more predominant than the reinforcing effect, a fact that could be responsible for the decrease of viscoelastic properties, crystallinity, and mechanical properties. &copy; 2015 Society of Plastics Engineers.

Abstract:The reaction mechanism for CO<inf>2</inf>absorption in amine solvent was investigated by theoretical analysis. The reactants were CO<inf>2</inf>and six amines, and the reactions were designed with or without additional water or amine molecule. These molecules increase the interaction between reactants and withdraw a proton from amino group of amine. From the additional amine model that shows lowest activation energy, zwitterionic and termolecular mechanisms seem to be suitable for CO<inf>2</inf>capturing reaction in amine solvents. Moreover, the additional amine model can be applied to understand the enhancement effect of CO<inf>2</inf>absorption in blended amine solvents. We report a new attempt that describes reaction mechanism in blended amine solvent by applying additional amine base. The results of CO<inf>2</inf>capture ability were analogous to experimental observation. Comparing our results and previous QM/MM and ab initio MD calculations, it was found that the QM treatment including the reactants and surrounding water molecules would be very critical and the QM region should be properly selected large enough in QM/MM. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:As a challenging high dimension optimization problem, three-dimensional path planning for Uninhabited Combat Air Vehicles (UCAV) mainly centralizes on optimizing the flight route with different types of constrains under complicated combating environments. An improved version of Bat Algorithm (BA) in combination with a Differential Evolution (DE), namely IBA, is proposed to optimize the UCAV three-dimensional path planning problem for the first time. In IBA, DE is required to select the most suitable individual in the bat population. By connecting the selected nodes using the proposed IBA, a safe path is successfully obtained. In addition, B-Spline curves are employed to smoothen the path obtained further and make it practically more feasible for UCAV. The performance of IBA is compared to that of the basic BA on a 3-D UCAV path planning problem. The experimental results demonstrate that IBA is a better technique for UCAV three-dimensional path planning problems compared to the basic BA model. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract:A mechanism for polystyrene hydrocracking on a bifunctional Pt/H-Beta catalyst has been proposed. The mechanism consists of three steps for polymer degradation: initiation, propagation and termination, and an additional step for transformation of aromatics, direct product of polystyrene degradation, into other hydrocarbons. The most important reactions in the last step are hydrogenation-dehydrogenation and ring opening reactions, to produce naphthenics, paraffins and isoparaffins, with higher added value as fuels. Finally, degradation of polystyrene by catalytic hydrocracking has been described by means of continuous distribution kinetics, which allows for modelling of the evolution of polymer molecular size and conversion with reaction time, and estimation of kinetic parameters associated to catalyst characteristics when working in the kinetic regime. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:Improper mandatory lane change (MLC) maneuvers in the vicinity of highway off-ramp will jeopardize traffic efficiency and safety. Providing an advance warning for lane change necessity is one of the efficient methods to perform systematic lane change management, which encourages smooth MLC maneuvers occurring at proper locations to mitigate the negative effects of MLC maneuvers on traffic flow nearby off-ramp. However, the state of the art indicates the lack of rigorous methods to optimally locate this advance warning so that the maximum benefit can be obtained. This research is motivated to address this gap. Specifically, the proposed approach considers that the area downstream of the advance warning includes two zones: (i) the green zone whose traffic ensures safe and smooth lane changes without speed deceleration (S-MLC); the start point of the green zone corresponding to the location of the advance warning; (ii) the yellow zone whose traffic leads to rush lane change maneuvers with speed deceleration (D-MLC). An optimization model is proposed to search for the optimal green and yellow zones. Traffic flow theory such as Greenshield model and shock wave analysis are used to analyze the impacts of the S-MLC and D-MLC maneuvers on the traffic delay. A grid search algorithm is applied to solve the optimization model. Numerical experiments conducted on the simulation model developed in Paramics 6.9.3 indicate that the proposed optimization model can identify the optimal location to set the advance MLC warning nearby an off-ramp so that the traffic delay resulting from lane change maneuvers is minimized, and the corresponding capacity drop and traffic oscillation can be efficiently mitigated. Moreover, the experiments validated the consistency of the green and yellow zones obtained in the simulation traffic flow and from the optimization model for a given optimally located MLC advance warning under various traffic regimes. The proposed approach can be implemented by roadside mobile warning facility or on-board GPS for human-driven vehicles, or embedded into lane change aid systems to serve connected and automated vehicles. Thus it will greatly contribute to both literature and engineering practice in lane change management. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:In this paper, a single DOF anthropomorphic finger module specifically designed for aerial manipulation and grasping is presented, where low weight and compliance are required features for safer performance of the aerial platform. The under-actuated mechanism consists of a high torque micro motor with a small reel for driving a tendon that moves the three joints of the finger. An elastic element maintains the finger bones tied together and extended by default, providing a compliant response against collisions with walls, the floor or any object in the environment during the grasping operation. Compliance provided by the elastic joints will also be exploited for stable object grasping and for collision detection. The development of a specific electronics for finger control instead of employing conventional servos make possible the design and application of a wider range of control strategies, including position, velocity or open-loop force control. The proposed design is validated through different grasping and control experiments. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

Abstract:In this paper, an intelligent fault diagnosis system based on instantaneous power spectrum analysis is proposed. The instantaneous noise variations and sensor off-sets are considered to be one of the common factors that yield erroneous fault tracking in an online condition monitoring and fault diagnosis system. The developed system has the capability to detect bearing inner race defects at incipient stages with in an arbitrary noise conditions. An adaptive threshold has been designed to deal with line current noise ambiguities for decision-making on the existence of small fault signatures. The performance of the developed system has been analyzed theoretically and experimentally on a custom designed test rig under various loading conditions of the motor. &copy; 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Abstract:This work is concerned with the asymptotic solutions of the axisymmetric plane strain problem involving the fractional order heat conduction. The governing equations for the axisymmetric plane strain problem are derived by means of fractional calculus. The Laplace transform technique is used to obtain the general solutions for any set of boundary conditions in the physical domain. The asymptotic solutions for a specific problem of an infinite cylinder with the boundary subjected to a thermal shock is derived by means of the limit theorem of Laplace transform. Utilizing these solutions, the thermoelastic behavior induced by transient thermal shock can be clearly illustrated, and the jumps locating at the position of each wavefront can also be accurately captured. Some comparisons for the predictions of thermoelastic response are conducted to estimate the effect of the fractional order parameter on the thermoelastic behavior. &copy; 2016 Taylor & Francis, Group, LLC.

Abstract:When forming fiber thermoplastic composites, the specific reactions of the composites' components to forming forces lead to a change in orientation and position of the fibers and the matrix material. After bending fiber reinforced thermoplastics along their fiber orientation, fiber waviness on the surface of the inner and outer arc becomes visible. Therefore, an optical system is presented that is capable of detecting the fiber waviness on the component's surfaces. For imaging, a robot-guided light-section sensor acquires the geometry of the specimens, followed by a texture acquisition to merge the texture with the geometry data. The resulting model is used to detect local fiber paths and lengths. The quotient of the fiber lengths over the arc lengths within a defined analysis corridor is calculated to get a relative factor for the waviness. The results are analyzed in respect to the geometrical arc length deviation. Therewith, the forming mechanisms of the utilized bending method can be evaluated. An initial validation of the waviness determination is performed by repeat tests which show, that the method is generally feasible of detecting the fiber waviness. &copy; 2015 Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.

Abstract:We investigated the effect of preexisting plastic deformation with the strain of 30% on the creep behavior of TP347 austenitic steel at 650. &deg;C with different applied stresses. The results showed that the creep rupture life of the prestrained sample increased more than that of the unstrained sample tested at 300, 250 and 200. MPa due to the strengthening of the mechanical twins induced by preexisting plastic deformation. Conversely, the prestrained samples were ruptured earlier than that of the unstrained sample tested when the lower creep stresses (150 and 125. MPa) were applied. The shorter creep rupture life of the prestrained sample was due to the reduced amount of time to a minimum creep rate and the shorter tertiary-stage creep time which can be related to the accelerated precipitation of sigma phase at the grain boundaries in the strained sample. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:Portlandite is an important constituent of cementitious materials. Consequently the growth of portlandite is of great interest to fully understand the hydration of cement, a process still posing many scientific challenges. In this paper the growth of portlandite in aqueous systems is studied by simulating the adsorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup>and OH<sup>-</sup>at different portlandite surfaces. For the simulation an adapted version of the Freeman (Freeman et al., 2007) in combination with the TIP4P/2005 (Abascal and Vega, 2005) force field was used for both molecular dynamics, conventional and well-tempered metadynamics calculations. Depending on the structure of the portlandite-water interface, different adsorption sites were observed. Based on these we were able to propose an atomistic mechanism of portlandite growth in different crystallographic directions. The proposed mechanism indicates that different species control the growth in different directions, consistent with experimental observations reported in literature (Arnold, 2004). &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:The thermal conductivity of polycarbonate-graphene nanocomposite foams was studied as a function of relative density, developed cellular structure and graphene concentration. Two types of supercritical CO<inf>2</inf>foaming processes were employed to obtain foams with a wide range of relative densities and cellular morphologies. The thermal conductivity of unfoamed nanocomposites increased in more than two times upon addition of 5 wt% graphene. Foaming led to lowered thermal conductivity values, as low as 0.03 W/(m K), with thermal conductivity being mainly controlled by relative density and in a lower extent by graphene concentration. Higher thermal conductivities were obtained with increasing relative density and cell size, as well as with increasing graphene concentration, especially in those cases where improved graphene dispersion was achieved with foaming. Thermal conductivity values displayed a better fit when using a three-phase model when compared to the two-phase model previously proposed for polymer composite foams. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:Bedding separation in roof strata (BSRS) overlying roadways within thick coal seams (RTCS) is an important factor leading to surrounding instability in underground coal mines, and especially to roof failures such as convergence, and even caving-in. To prevent reason, and to protect the working miners, it is essential to understand the mechanism of underpinning BSRS overlying RTCS. In this research, combined with the theoretical analysis and test results of continuous, and discontinuous, beams and stratified rock strata load, a new approach to predict the locations at which BSRS occurred was proposed; additionally, the calculation equation for BSRS was deduced. Based on standard monitoring methods widely used in exploring roof behaviour in underground coal roadways, a typical roadway excavated within 12.87 m, in an average thickness coal seam, in Jinggonger coal mine, Pingshuo Coalfield, Shanxi Province, China, that was chosen to explore the mechanism underpinning BSRS, and a set of monitoring designs, mainly including five groups of stations and 16 instruments, is determined and applied to this research. Results showed that the predicted locations of BSRS overlying RTCS were in accordance with field monitoring results. This proved the validity of the theoretical model. Besides, the working face played an important role in BSRS and 75% of the BSRS events were generated within the 50 m between the monitoring station and the working face. When the distance was decreased to 5 m, the BSRS was up to 90.9 mm and 86 mm at depths of 6.8 m and 3.8 m, respectively. Meanwhile, three stages were considered, step-by-step, as opposed to mining activity dependent upon the extent of its influence on BSRS: a pink value (indicative of an alarm status) prevailed during the third stage. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract:The purpose of this study was to investigate the healing process of wounded skin following the application of cyanoacrylate or a 4-(2-methacryloxyethyl) trimellitic anhydride/methyl methacrylate-tributylborane resin (4-META resin). Those materials were applied to skin wound areas in rats, and the regenerating tissues were biopsied and examined at days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14. Paraffin-embedded specimens were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or with Azan-Mallory stain. Sections were also immunohistochemically stained with Pan-cytokeratin and CD68 antibodies. In cyanoacrylate-treated wounds, CD68-positive cells were observed in the connective tissue and their number increased up to day 5. The wound surface was completely covered by epithelial tissue at day 14. In 4-META resin-treated wounds, CD68-positive cells appeared in the soft-tissue hybrid layer (STHL) and epithelial tissue had migrated under the STHL by day 5. The wound surface was completely covered by epithelial tissue at day 7. CD68-positive cells were distributed over the entire area of the cyanoacrylate-treated wounds, but accumulated under the STHL in the 4-META resin-treated wounds. In conclusion, the results suggest that covering skin defects with a 4-META resin is an effective strategy to promote wound healing compared to cyanoacrylate. &copy; 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract:Context. The mid-IR detection rate of water lines in disks around Herbig stars disks is about 5%, while it is around 50% for disks around T Tauri stars. The reason for this is still unclear. Aims. In this study, we want to find an explanation for the different detection rates between low mass and high mass pre-main-sequence stars in the mid-IR regime. Methods. We ran disk models with stellar parameters adjusted to spectral types B9 through M2, using the radiation thermo-chemical disk modelling code ProDiMo. We explored also a small parameter space around a standard disk model, considering dust-to-gas mass ratio, disk gas mass, mixing coefficient for dust settling, flaring index, dust maximum size, and size power law distribution index. We produced convolved spectra at the resolution of Spitzer, IRS, JWST MIRI, and VLT VISIR spectrographs. We applied random noise derived from typical Spitzer spectra for a direct comparison with observations. Results. The strength of the mid-IR water lines correlates directly with the luminosity of the central star. The models show that it is possible to suppress the water emission; however, current observations are not sensitive enough to detect mid-IR lines in disks for most of the explored parameters. The presence of noise in the spectra, combined with the high continuum flux (noise level is proportional to the continuum flux), is the most likely explanation for the non-detections towards Herbig stars. Conclusions. Mid-IR spectra with resolution higher than 20 000 are needed to investigate water in protoplanetary disks. Intrinsic differences in disk structure, such as inner gaps, gas-to-dust ratio, dust size and distribution, and inner disk scale height, between Herbig and T Tauri star disks are able to explain a lower water detection rate in disks around Herbig stars. &copy; ESO, 2015.

Abstract:Binding interactions between surface active ionic liquid (SAIL) [C<inf>8</inf>mim][Br] and sodium polystyrene sulfonate (NaPSS), an anionic polyelectrolyte were analyzed from techniques such as conductometry, tensiometry, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and fluorimetry. Typical surface tension profile shows the existence of noticeable elevation in the value of surface tension at IL concentrations before the critical micelle concentration (cmc) of the SAIL. By using conductivity measurements we have calculated the cmc and degree of ionization, &alpha;, at various temperatures from 298.15 to 318.15 K. A series of thermodynamic parameters like standard enthalpy of micellization (&delta;H<inf>m</inf><sup>&deg;</sup>), standard free energy of micellization (&delta;G<inf>m</inf><sup>&deg;</sup>) and standard entropy of micellization (&delta;S<inf>m</inf><sup>&deg;</sup>) have been evaluated. Behavior of fluorescence probe, pyrene and DLS measurements confirm the binding interactions between SAIL and the polyelectrolyte. It has been found that the cmc values significantly increase with higher concentration of polyelectrolyte due to hydrophobic interactions. The Gibb's free energy (&delta;G<inf>m</inf><sup>&deg;</sup>) is negative for the above systems and increases with increasing polyelectrolyte concentration. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:The influence of acid type (acetic, citric, lactic and hydrochloric acids) on caseinomacropeptide (CMP) self-assembly, rheological and textural properties was analysed. The acidulant selection had a large impact on self-assembly rate, gelation and the hardness of CMP gels. The highest self-assembly and gelation rates were for citric acid, followed by hydrochloric and lactic acids. CMP solutions did not gel when the pH was adjusted with acetic acid during the test period. Product development using CMP must be carefully designed from the point of view of gel properties. A product preparation with CMP gelled with lactic or acetic acids would not be recommended because these acids affect the rheological and textural properties of the gels. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:T-joints are one of the most common welded joints used in the construction of offshore structures, including ships and platforms. In the present study, a sequentially coupled thermo-mechanical finite element model that considers temperature-dependent material properties, high temperature effects and a moving volumetric heat source was used to investigate the effect of welding sequence on the residual stresses and distortions in T-joint welds. The parameters of Goldak's double ellipsoidal heat source model were predicted using a neural network. The numerical models were successfully validated by the experimental tests. The results show that the welding sequences have significant effects on the residual stresses and distortions, both in the magnitude and distribution mode. The optimization of the welding sequences should be investigated numerically or experimentally before the construction welded structure. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:Triple oxygen isotopes within post-Marinoan barites have played an integral role in our understanding of Cryogenian glaciations. Reports of anomalous &delta;O17 values within cap carbonate hosted barites however have remained restricted to South China and Mauritania. Here we extend the &delta;O17 anomaly to northwest Canada with our new measurements of barites from the Ravensthroat cap dolostone with a minimum &delta;O17 value of -0.75&permil;. For the first time we pair triple oxygen with multiple sulfur isotopic data as a tool to identify the key processes that controlled the post-Marinoan sulfur cycle. We argue using a dynamic 1-box model that the observed isotopic trends both in northwest Canada and South China can be explained through the interplay between sulfide weathering, microbial sulfur cycling and pyrite burial. An important outcome of this study is a new constraint placed on the size of the post-Marinoan sulfate reservoir (&asymp;0.1% modern), with a maximum concentration of less than 10% modern. Through conservative estimates of sulfate fluxes from sulfide weathering and under a small initial sulfate reservoir, we suggest that observed isotopic trends are the product of a dynamic sulfur cycle that saw both the addition and removal of the &delta;O17 anomaly over four to five turnovers of the post-Marinoan marine sulfate reservoir. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V..

Abstract:Multi-UAV missions are complex systems that may include a fleet of UAVs, a crew of operators and different computers and interfaces. Currently, an important challenge is the reduction of the number of operators that is required for performing a multi-UAV mission. This challenge can be addressed by increasing the autonomy of fleets and providing capabilities of operators to the interfaces. This paper presents a proposal of control architecture for multi-UAVmissions. This architecture shares some elements with centralized and distributed approaches and it has three layers: mission, task and action. The mission layer is implemented in the GCS and performs the mission planning and operator interfacing. Meanwhile, the task and action layers are located in the UAVs and perform respectively the task planning and executing. This architecture is applied to a simulation environment that reproduce a competitive scenario with two fleets of UAVs. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

Abstract:It is a very common phenomenon that airline passengers always instinctively choose the nearest exit to evacuate in emergency situations. However, such a decision may not be the wisest choice as airline passengers oftentimes lack awareness of aircraft configurations and evacuation capacity of each available exit. To improve the efficiency of aircraft emergency evacuation, a direction guidance system that guides passengers to escape from the optimal exits is proposed. Determining the optimal evacuation directions via the evacuation simulation model developed in our earlier work can essentially be viewed as an optimization problem. The kriging model, acting as a metamodel, is utilized to alleviate computational burden of running the simulation model and approximate the underlying relationship between inputs (evacuation signs) and outputs (evacuation time). To improve the accuracy of the kriging model at the region of interest, a sequential sampling strategy is used to add extra samples as a complement to the initial sample set to tune the initial kriging model. The decision validation metrics along with a termination criterion are used to validate the globally optimal solution with a certain degree of confidence. As demonstrated in the case studies, the proposed metamodel-based optimization method is computationally efficient and the evacuation time can be significantly saved. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:This paper investigates input-to-state stability (ISS) and integral input-to-state stability (iISS) for a class of impulsive switched systems with time-delay under asynchronous switching, using the method of multiple Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. The asynchronous switching means that the switchings between the candidate controllers and system modes are not synchronous due to the switching delay. It is shown that, even if all the subsystems governing the continuous dynamics, in the absence of impulses, are not ISS/iISS, impulses can successfully stabilize the system in the ISS/iISS sense with the matched controller if the length of the impulsive interval is large enough. Conversely, when the delayed continuous dynamics are ISS/iISS but the discrete dynamics governing the impulses are not, the ISS/iISS property of the hybrid system can be retained with the matched controller if the impulsive interval and the switching delay are small enough. Finally, two illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the results. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:The production of non-spherical gold nanoparticles is a rather complex process and requires a multistep synthesis including surface blocking detergents such as CTAC and CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium chloride; -bromide). Especially gold nanocubes are difficult to realize since they have six close packed 100-planes and they need at least three separate, highly controlled production steps: the synthesis step, where the seed particles will be formed, followed by two independent growing steps. One main challenge is to find the optimal conditions for the different steps, since the incubation times differs in several magnitudes for each step (seeds: ms, growing solution 1: sec, growing solution 2: min). Based on this discrepancy we present a study and comparison of different synthetic methods for each step. Starting with a classical batch approach we also transferred the synthesis into microfluidics and therefore compare continuous (one-phase) as well as segmented flow techniques, and discusses the benefits of each method. We present the additional advantage of CTAC in microfluidics since it passivates the channel surfaces and thereby inhibits clogging. A further detailed kinetic study of the two growing steps identifies the incubation time as critical parameter for a defined (cubed-like) geometry and facilitates the use of microfluidic methods for the first growing step, since it eliminates subjective decisions. Due to the kinetic study in combination with electron-microscopic characterization we propose a Figure Of Merit (FOM) for the second growth step that simplifies the evaluation of the point in time when to terminate the reaction to obtain perfectly shaped Au nanocubes. We also demonstrate the sensitivity (comparison of Au nanocube and Au nanosphere) and the possibility of tuning the cube edge length (and so the plasmon peak position) and highlight their correlation as a fundament for an automated microfluidic synthesis and versatile applications, like biosensing. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:Solid solution-treated binary Al-20% Zn alloy was deformed by rolling and accumulative roll bonding in the equivalent strain range of 0.19-12.05 at room temperature. The grain size of the Al matrix decreases with the increase in deformation degree and reaches the nanometre range. The dislocation density initially increased with the deformation degree and then decreased. The Zn-phase particles were dynamically precipitated from the Al-Zn supersaturated solid solution and then coarsened during rolling. Rolling after the strain of 12.05 did not result in full decomposition of the solid solution. The hardness of the Al-Zn was also investigated. Results showed that the value reached up to 119.76. Hv at a strain of 2.92 and then decreased with increasing rolling strain. At the early stage of rolling, the strengthening mechanism of the rolled Al-Zn alloy included work hardening by dislocations, precipitation strengthening by nanosized precipitates and boundary strengthening by grain refinement. When the strain was larger than 2.92, the Al-Zn alloy's consistent softening was attributed to the decomposition of supersaturated solid solution, coarsening of the precipitate phase and annihilation of dislocations during severe plastic deformation. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:Asphodeline species are traditionally used as food and medicines. The different extracts (acetone, methanol and water) from different parts (stem, root, seed and leaf) of Asphodeline anatolica were screened for inhibitory potentials on cholinesterase, tyrosinase, &alpha;-amylase and &alpha;-glucosidase. Enzyme inhibitory effects were investigated by using microplate reader. All studied extracts exhibited remarkable inhibitory effects on the tested enzymes. Generally, acetone and methanol extracts have higher potentials than water extracts. Also, the enzyme inhibitory activities of the extracts varied significantly according to the plant parts as well as the solvent used. R-Met (7.42. mgGALAEs/g extract) and St-Ac (10.74. mgGALAEs/g extract) had the highest acetylcholinesterase and butrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity, respectively. R-Met (22.48. mgKAEs/g extract) exhibited the strongest tyrosinase inhibitory effects, while Se-Ac had the most potent activity on both &alpha;-amylase (2.53. mmolACAEs/g extract) and &alpha;-glucosidase (6.70. mmolACAEs/g extract). The results suggested that the A. anatolica extract may be useful for food and medicinal applications. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:Orthotropic steel decks are wildly used in long-span bridges, however fatigue cracks occurring in the decks have been reported since 1971. To improve the fatigue performance of the steel deck, some remedial techniques have been applied. Among them, is a technique called Impact Crack-Closure Retrofit treatment (ICR treatment) which has been developed in recent years. In this paper, the welded joints were treated by ICR technique, without load applied. Surface stress around the welded joints was monitored by strain gauges during the ICR process, and residual stress before and after treatment was determined by blind-hole technique respectively. The stress distribution alone the thickness direction was obtained by the micro-hardness test. Results of this study show that the residual stress after the ICR treatment can be decreased. Meanwhile compressive stress contributing to improving the fatigue strength is generated on the near-surface. The depth of the compressive stress distribution is about 5.3 mm from this test, and it well agrees with the finite element method (FEM) results. The accuracy of the FEM results also indicates that simulating the ICR treatment by an ascribed local plastic deformation is possible. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract:In hilly terrains, the exploitation of (semi-)autonomous systems able to travel nimbly and safely on different terrains and perform agricultural operations is still far from reality. In this perspective, the articulated 4-wheeled system, that shows an optimal steering capacity and the possibility to adapt to uneven terrains thanks to a passive degree of freedom on the central joint, is one of the most promising mobile wheeledrobot architectures. In thiswork, the instability of this robotic platform is evaluated in the two different conditions, i.e. phase I and phase II [1], and the effect of blocking the passive DoF of the central joint investigated in order to highlight possible stabilizing conditions and best manoeuvring practices for overturning avoidance. In order to do so, a quasi-static model of the robotic platform has been developed and implemented in a Matlab<sup>&trade;</sup>simulator thanks to which the different conditions have been studied. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

Abstract:This study aims at an assessment of wind re-analyses for modelling storms in the Black Sea. A wind-wave modelling system (Simulating WAve Nearshore, SWAN) is applied to the Black Sea basin and calibrated with buoy data for three recent re-analysis wind sources, namely the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis-Interim (ERA-Interim), Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), and Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) during an extreme wave condition that occurred in the north eastern part of the Black Sea. The SWAN model simulations are carried out for default and tuning settings for deep water source terms, especially whitecapping. Performances of the best model configurations based on calibration with buoy data are discussed using data from the JASON2, TOPEX-Poseidon, ENVISAT and GFO satellites. The SWAN model calibration shows that the best configuration is obtained with Janssen and Komen formulations with whitecapping coefficient (C<inf>ds</inf>) equal to 1.8e-5 for wave generation by wind and whitecapping dissipation using ERA-Interim. In addition, from the collocated SWAN results against the satellite records, the best configuration is determined to be the SWAN using the CFSR winds. Numerical results, thus show that the accuracy of a wave forecast will depend on the quality of the wind field and the ability of the SWAN model to simulate the waves under extreme wind conditions in fetch limited wave conditions. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:Performance-based methodologies to evaluate the fire performance of structures are needed to move beyond the prescriptive procedures currently in use, which cannot be used to determine actual structural performance in fire. Analytical methods are needed for simulating the performance of structural systems, including connections, subject to realistic fire effects. Framing connections may be subject to large, unanticipated deformations and loads during fire events, and connection failure may lead to other failures or local collapse. This paper presents the development of detailed finite element models of typical moment connections for steel-framed structures. These detailed models incorporate temperature-dependent material models that have been calibrated against available test data from tensile coupons, including the modeling of necking behavior and fracture. The detailed connection models are loaded to failure to identify the applicable failure mechanisms. Connection performance at ambient and elevated temperatures is evaluated, and dominant failure modes are identified.

Abstract:We present a new adaptive algorithm to accelerate optimal feature extraction from a sequence of multi-class Gaussian data in order to classify them based on the Bayes decision rule. The optimal Gaussian feature extraction, in the Bayes sense, involves estimation of the square root of the inverse of the covariance matrix, &Sigma;<sup>-1/2</sup>. We use an appropriate cost function to find the optimal step size in each iteration, in order to accelerate the convergence rate of the previously proposed algorithm for adaptive estimation of &Sigma;<sup>-1/2</sup>. The performance of the proposed accelerated algorithm is compared with other adaptive &Sigma;<sup>-1/2</sup>algorithms. The proposed algorithm is tested for Gaussian feature extraction from three classes of three-dimensional Gaussian data. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for adaptive optimal feature extraction from a sequence of Gaussian data. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract:The governing equations for the one-dimensional consolidation of double-layered structured soils under time-dependent loading are established in this paper. Using simplified k-&sigma;<sup>'</sup>and m<inf>v</inf>-&sigma;<sup>'</sup>models, the double-layered structured soils can be analyzed with three- or four-layered soils in which the thicknesses of the upper and lower layers change gradually. Approximate solutions for the governing equations are then obtained for two types of boundary conditions, and a computer program is developed. Using these solutions and the computer program, the consolidation behavior of double-layered structured soils is investigated. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:The desorption electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) is known as a fast and convenient MS-based method for lipid imaging in various biological materials. Here, we applied this technique to visualize lipid distribution in a vascular graft removed from a patient's body. This is a good example of the DESI system capabilities toward imaging of interaction between artificial material and living tissues. Detailed analysis allowed for visualization of the spatial distribution of selected lipids in this implanted, artificial material. Not only DESI-MSI allowed visualization of lipid distribution in the investigated material but also enabled identification of the detected molecular species using MS/MS. Here, this technique was successfully used to evaluate the saturation and spatial distribution of endogenous lipids in the artificial vascular graft. Unambiguous identification of the lipids was done with the aid of fragmentation procedure. We also showed that various lipids localize preferably in graft material or internal plaque existing inside the graft. &copy; 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract:Rapid, reproducible and prolific in vitro plant regeneration via direct organogenesis has been achieved from axenic seedling derived nodal explants of Cucumis trigonus Roxb.-an underexploited plant of an immense industrial value in coming years. The organogenic capability of nodal segments was investigated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different concentrations of cytokinins and auxins either alone or in combinations. The highest frequency of shoot induction (92.00 &plusmn; 1.73) was achieved when nodal explants were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium incorporated with 2.0 mg/l 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) with an average of (4.90 &plusmn; 0.25) shoots per node explant. Microshoots exhibited best rooting response on 1/2 strength MS medium supplemented with 1.0 mg/l indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) by producing a highest frequency of root formation (100%), number of roots (21.6 &plusmn; 0.88) and root length (7.00 &plusmn; 0.73 cm) were achieved after four weeks. The rooted microshoots were successfully hardened and transplanted from different planting substrates to the field with maximum survival rate (95%). Micropropagated plants established ex-vitro was uniform and identical to donor plants with respect to vegetative and reproductive phase of growth. The present cost-effective regeneration protocol would facilitate an alternative method for fast mass multiplication of Cucumis trigonus to fulfil the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical needs of growing population. This the first report of an efficient in vitro regeneration protocol for C. trigonus through direct organogenesis via axenic seedling derived nodal explants, which can be efficiently applied for the exploitation of active biomolecules, genetic manipulations of commercially valuable genotypes of Cucumis and also helps to speed up cucurbit breeding programmes. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:As a part of complex works aiming at the evaluation of the pump&rsquo;s dynamic transfer matrix, this paper presents an estimation method of the speed of sound in water and water/air flows using three pressure transducer measurements. The experimental study was carried out at the CREMHyG acoustic test rig, for a void ratio varying from 0 to 1&nbsp;% and for amplitudes of speed of sound from 100 to 1400&nbsp;m/s. To estimate the speed of sound in this large range of amplitude, a new post-treatment approach was developed, based on the least mean squares method. Experimental results obtained were compared with existing theoretical models, and a very good agreement was observed. The post-processing appeared fast, robust and accurate for all the mono- and diphasic flows analyzed. The results presented in this paper can be applied, for instance, in acoustic characterization of the hydraulic systems, mainly in the case of space rocket turbopump applications. &copy; 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract:After many years at the forefront of renewable energy (RE) implementation both in Europe and worldwide, Spain experienced a sudden transformation in 2012 to its RE development model in which national government backing and financial incentives for renewables were removed, throwing the RE sector into a paralysis which continues to the present day. This is in marked contrast to the case of the other major European RE leader, Germany, where it has been argued that RE implementation has produced a "regime shift" that has transformed the energy generation model to a new resilient pathway. In this paper, key differences between Spanish regions are identified in the way the RE implementation process has been carried out. The research brings these different characteristics into focus and analyses the strengths and weaknesses of the RE implementation process in each region. If stakeholders at all levels are empowered and motivated towards the implementation process goal, it is less likely that a few, very powerful actors (e.g. multinational energy companies or governments) can dominate the process, and thus systemic instability can be reduced. In this way, lock-down situations like the current one can be avoided in future and a more resilient system can be designed. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:Hypertension is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, kidney disease, and stroke. Interest in medicinal or nutraceutical plant bioactives to reduce hypertension has increased dramatically. The main biological regulation of mammalian blood pressure is via the renin&ndash;angiotensin-aldosterone system. The key enzyme is angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) that converts angiotensin I into the powerful vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II binds to its receptors (AT<inf>1</inf>) on smooth muscle cells of the arteriole vasculature causing vasoconstriction and elevation of blood pressure. This review focuses on the in vitro and in vivo reports of plant-derived extracts that inhibit ACE activity, block angiotensin II receptor binding and demonstrate hypotensive activity in animal or human studies. We describe 74 families of plants that exhibited significant ACE inhibitory activity and 16 plant families with potential AT<inf>1</inf>receptor blocking activity, according to in vitro studies. From 43 plant families including some of those with in vitro bioactivity, the extracts from 73 plant species lowered blood pressure in various normotensive or hypertensive in vivo models by the oral route. Of these, 19 species from 15 families lowered human BP when administered orally. Some of the active plant extracts, isolated bioactives and BP-lowering mechanisms are discussed. &copy; 2016, Copyright &copy; CSIRO.

Abstract:Gamma irradiated single crystal of Guaifenesin (Glyceryl Guaiacolate), an important expectorant drug, were investigated with Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy between 123 and 333. K temperature at different orientations in the magnetic field. Considering the chemical structure and the experimental spectra of the gamma irradiated single crystal of guaifenesin sample, we assumed that alkoxy or alkyl-type paramagnetic species may be produced by irradiation. Depending on this assumption, eight possible alkoxy and alkyl-type radicals were modeled and EPR parameters of these modeled radicals were calculated using the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)-level of density functional theory (DFT). Theoretically calculated values of alkyl-type modeled radical(R3) are in good agreement with experimentally determined EPR parameters of single crystal. Furthermore, simulation spectra which are obtained by using the theoretical initial values are well matched with the experimental spectra. It was determined that a stable C&alpha;&bull;H2&alpha;C&beta;H&beta;C&gamma;H2&gamma; (R3) alkyl radical was produced in the host crystal as a result of gamma irradiation. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:This study was carried out to assess the land suitability for rainfed faba bean (Vicia faba L.) cultivation in Gonbad-Kavous region (Golestan province, north of Iran) using geographic information system (GIS) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP), the most common methods for evaluation of land use suitability. Several parameters were considered in this study, including the annual average, minimum and maximum temperatures, annual precipitation, slope, elevation, and some soil properties such as organic matter, pH, EC, texture, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, iron, and zinc. The environmental parameters and the classification system used in the this work are inspired by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) method dedicated to land suitability. In determining the weights of parameters, expert opinions were consulted and the final land suitability map was generated in five classes. As evidenced by the results, it was estimated that 23.48% of the study area (48,354.5 ha) is highly suitable for faba bean cropping, while 25.38% (52,237.37 ha) is moderately suitable and 25.03% (51,522.85 ha) is marginally suitable. In addition, our results indicated that just 26.11% of total agricultural lands are non-suitable for crop production. The currently non-suitable (49,778.80 ha) and permanently non-suitable (3997.09 ha) classes are located in the north and northwest parts of Gonbad-Kavous township. Soil salinity, low organic matter, low precipitation, high Ca content, and deficiency of P and Fe contents were found to be key limiting factors in this area. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:Global measurements of turbulent flows at wall&ndash;cylinder junctions are employed to quantify the effects of wall roughness on the behavior of the horseshoe vortex system (HVS). Two laboratory setups were considered: one with an impermeable smooth wall and a second characterized by a porous hydraulically rough bed. The measurements were obtained using planar particle image velocimetry. Time-averaged flow topology, turbulence statistics, and instantaneous fields associated with the streamwise and wall-normal velocity components are emphasized. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is also applied on the velocity signals to probe into the characteristics of the energetic flow structures. For the Reynolds numbers studied here and the specific differences in the roughness geometry of the bed, a clear trend for the increase in flow incoherence due to the rough wall is documented. It is also demonstrated that, in the presence of roughness, vorticity and turbulence spread more evenly throughout the junction. On the other hand, qualitative and quantitative agreement between the smooth and rough bed tests is found in the structure of the downflow and the near-wall jet opposing the bulk flow. The efficiency of POD in analyzing turbulent junction flows is justified based on its results and metrics of modal energy distribution. POD verified in an objective way the role of integral components of the HVS dynamics such as the vortices comprising the system and their interplay with the wall. The decomposition furnishes new evidence about energetic structures that were not captured with the other data analysis methodologies. It also confirms the aperiodic behavior of the HVS for the investigated Reynolds numbers. &copy; 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract:Imaging by dielectric microspheres embedded in thin film is a simple technique to achieve optical super-resolution. However, the film-thickness effect has not caused enough attention, and its field of view (FOV) is very limited. We first introduce a method to fabricate barium titanate glass (BTG) microsphere-embedded ultrathin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films, and study their sub-wavelength imaging properties as a function of the film thickness. Our experimental results reveal that for an individual microsphere, its FOV obviously increases as the film thickness decreases, while the corresponding magnification changes barely. When the PDMS film thickness is 5&ndash;10&nbsp;&mu;m, the FOV of a microsphere is the largest, and the images produced by the neighboring close-packed microspheres with the same size can be stitched together to form a large image, realizing effective view expansion. Our results will boost the practical capacity of BTG microsphere-embedded film for sub-wavelength imaging. &copy; 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract:The abundance, diversity and community structure of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were investigated, using amoA gene as a molecular biomarker, to examine how cattail (Typha orientalis) growth affects the abundances and communities of AOB and AOA in the rhizosphere sediment. Clone libraries and qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) results indicated the amoA gene copies numbers, relative abundance of AOA and AOB amoA gene clone libraries were highest in rhizosphere sediment, followed by non-rhizosphere sediment and control, indicating that cattail growth has a remarkable effect on the abundance and community structure of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms. Diversity index (Chao1 and Shannon H) have an obvious variation in cattail rhizosphere, non-rhizosphere and control sediments. The average values of Shannon H of AOA and AOB in the rhizosphere sediment were higher than the non-rhizosphere sediment and control. The average value of Chao1 was highest in non-rhizosphere sediment for AOA, whereas, was highest in the rhizosphere sediment for AOB. The abundance, diversity and community structure of AOA and AOB were obvious different in the cattail's three developmental stages, and higher abundances and more complex community structure were obtained in the maturity stage, which may be attributable to the higher root exudation owing to fast growth rates and strong metabolisms in the maturity stage. In addition, despite higher abundant of AOA versus AOB was demonstrated in the cattail rhizosphere, non-rhizosphere sediment and control, bacteria, not archaeal, have more ecosystem functions and play a more important role in dominating ammonia oxidation under the conditions of this study according to the two findings from the present study. One is that AOB had a more diverse and more complex community structure than AOA; the other is that the average value of potential nitrification rates (PNRs) significantly decreased (by 49.08%, 53.69% and 10.39%, respectively) in rhizosphere, non-rhizosphere sediment and control, as compared to PNRs without the ampicillin, when ammonia-oxidizing bacteria were inhibited by ampicillin. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:An efficient MgO-stabilized CaO sorbent via the citric acid treated dolomite coupled with carbonization process (denoted as carbon coating) was developed for CO<inf>2</inf>capture at high temperature. The citric acid was used as a carbon source to produce the coated carbon, which was expected to effectively prevent the crystallites (CaO and MgO) from sintering. The original dolomite and citric-acid-treated dolomite with subsequent calcination in air were also prepared for comparison. Different characterizations (thermal decomposition, phase composition, morphology, and nitrogen adsorption) were performed. The cyclic-CO<inf>2</inf>-capture performance was tested in a fix-bed reactor. During the carbonization in N<inf>2</inf>atmosphere, the acidified dolomite transformed into carbon-coated, Mg-doped calcite, which could control thermal sintering and prevent the de-mixing of CaO and MgO in the secondary calcination step in air. Thus, the sorbent prepared using carbon coating achieved smaller grains, larger specific surface area and pore volume and more uniform distribution of CaO and MgO, which led to its superior activity and stability, compared to two reference sorbents. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:Recent research has strengthened the understanding of the links between climate and tropical cyclones (TCs) on various timescales. Geological records of past climates have shown century-long variations in TC numbers. While no significant trends have been identified in the Atlantic since the late 19th century, significant observed trends in TC numbers and intensities have occurred in this basin over the past few decades, and trends in other basins are increasingly being identified. However, understanding of the causes of these trends is incomplete, and confidence in these trends continues to be hampered by a lack of consistent observations in some basins. A theoretical basis for maximum TC intensity appears now to be well established, but a climate theory of TC formation remains elusive. Climate models mostly continue to predict future decreases in global TC numbers, projected increases in the intensities of the strongest storms and increased rainfall rates. Sea level rise will likely contribute toward increased storm surge risk. Against the background of global climate change and sea level rise, it is important to carry out quantitative assessments on the potential risk of TC-induced storm surge and flooding to densely populated cities and river deltas. Several climate models are now able to generate a good distribution of both TC numbers and intensities in the current climate. Inconsistent TC projection results emerge from modeling studies due to different downscaling methodologies and warming scenarios, inconsistencies in projected changes of large-scale conditions, and differences in model physics and tracking algorithms.

Abstract:In this paper a modified method of generalized sample entropy and surrogate data analysis is proposed as a new measure to assess the complexity of a complex dynamical system such as stock market. The method based on Hausdorff distance presents a different way of time series patterns match showing distinct behaviors of complexity. Simulations are conducted over synthetic and real-world data for providing the comparative study. Results show that the modified method is more sensitive to the change of dynamics and has richer information. In addition, exponential functions can be used to successfully fit the curves obtained from the modified method and quantify the changes of complexity for stock market data. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:Understanding current technological changes is the basis for better forecasting of technological changes. Because technology is path dependent, monitoring past and current trends of technological development helps managers and decision makers to identify probable future technologies in order to prevent organizational failure. This study suggests a method based on patent-development paths, k-core analysis and topic modeling of past and current trends of technological development to identify technologies that have the potential to become disruptive technologies. We find that within the photovoltaic industry, thin-film technology is likely to replace the dominant technology, namely crystalline silicon. In addition, we identity the hidden technologies, namely multi-junction, dye-sensitized and concentration technologies, that have the potential to become disruptive technologies within the three main technologies of the photovoltaic industry. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract:Coal fires burning around the world over many years have been responsible for the loss of natural resources and also for negative environmental and human-health impacts. Study of self-burning coal wastes based on organic petrology, mineralogy and geochemistry allows the evaluation of factors responsible for the combustion process, and can also be used to assess the changes that are taking place in thermally affected materials. The main goal of this study is to characterize the materials from the Arroyo Galladas, Arroyo Mourin and Fabero coal waste piles, which resulted from coal mining in the El Bierzo Coalfield (NW Spain). Samples of coal, and of unburned and burned or burning coal waste material, were studied by optical microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The results demonstrate that some of the organic matter has preserved its characteristics, but other organic material shows signs of thermal alteration such as cracks, devolatilization vacuoles, dark reaction rims, plasticized edges, and increased or decreased vitrinite reflectance. The resistance of the unaltered organic matter to thermal effects is attributed to the coalification process previously undergone by these coals. The mineralogical composition of the samples indicates that newly formed minerals are present in the burned or burning material, including mullite, cristobalite, cordierite, hematite, jarosite, sanidine, anorthite, sulfur, pyrite, rozenite, coquimbite, tschermigite, boussingaultite and amorphous material. The formation of these minerals is attributed to combustion at maximum temperatures of at least 1100. &deg;C in the Fabero coal waste pile and lower temperatures in the Arroyo Galladas coal waste pile, and to interaction of gases released by combustion with the solid particles, the waters and the atmosphere in and around the waste piles. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:Magnetoelectric (ME) composites of Na, Bi, Sr substituted lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and yttrium iron garnet having representative formula (100-x) wt% Na,Bi,Sr-doped PZT (PZTNB-1)+x wt% Y<inf>3</inf>Fe<inf>5</inf>O<inf>12</inf>(YIG) with x=10-90 were manufactured using powdered components obtained through sol-gel processes. It is shown that the decrease in sintering temperature provided by the use of finely dispersed PZTNB-1 and YIG powders allows to significantly reduce content of fluorite-like foreign phase based on zirconium oxide, which forms due to the interfacial interaction during heat treatment and becomes stabilized by yttrium oxide. Connectivity has considerable effect on the value of ME coefficient of composite ceramics. With the same x value, &Delta;E/&Delta;H characteristic decreases when changing from 0-3-type structured composites (PZT grains embedded in ferrite matrix) to 3-3-(interpenetrating network of two phases) and especially 3-0-type samples (YIG grains embedded in PZT matrix); in the last case this can be attributed to the substrate clamping effect when ferrite grains are clamped with piezoelectric matrix. &Delta;E/&Delta;H value of 0-3 composites with x=40-60 wt% was found to be &sim;1.6 mV/(cm Oe). &copy; 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:Stock assessment of roach (Rutilus rutilus) in the river Meuse (Belgium), based on two decades of research, indicated a sudden stock decline since the early 2010s. While roach was very abundant during the 1990s and beginning of the 2000s with densities estimated around 3000-3700fishha<sup>-1</sup>, densities dropped below 400fishha<sup>-1</sup>since 2010. A drop in primary production since 2005 and an increase in predation pressure by the Great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) between 2000 and 2006 are listed among potential explanations. In the present study, three scenarios were explored using an age-structured Leslie matrix to investigate if bottom-up control (phytoplankton driven), top-down control (predation driven) or a combination of both can explain the observed decline of roach stock. Including only a phytoplankton-dependent reduction of carrying capacity into the model (i.e. bottom-up control) accurately predicted the observed densities. If only predation by wintering populations of Great Cormorant was considered, the model did not predict the observed decline in roach stock. Combining top-down and bottom-up effects into the model resulted in a comparable fit as when including bottom-up effects alone. Taken together, our results suggest that roach decline is mainly driven by phytoplankton decline. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:Geophysical monitoring activities were an important component of the CO<inf>2</inf>injection program at the Ketzin site, Germany. Here we report on the seismic and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) measurements performed during the period of the site development and CO<inf>2</inf>injection. Details on the site geology, the history of the CO<inf>2</inf>injection operation, and petrophysical models relevant for the interpretation of the geophysical data are presented. The seismic measurements comprise 2D and 3D surface seismic surveys, vertical seismic profilings, and crosshole measurements. Apart from the measurements, results from advanced processing methods, such as impedance inversion and full-waveform inversion are also presented. In addition, results from crosshole ERT and surface-downhole ERT are presented. If operational efforts are taken into consideration we conclude that a combination of several geophysical methods is preferable given the demands of a spatiotemporally comprehensive monitoring program. We base this conclusion on that the different imaging characteristics and petrophysical sensitivities of different methods can complement each other. An important finding is, based on signal quality and reduced operational costs, that the use of permanent installations is promising. Generally, specific monitoring layouts will depend on site-specific characteristics, such as reservoir depth, availability of wells, petrophysical characteristics, and accessibility of surface locations. Given the comprehensive range of methods applied, the reported results are not only relevant to the operation of CO<inf>2</inf>storage sites, but are also of interest to other monitoring projects dealing with fluid injection or production. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:The Italian vessel Costa Concordia wrecked on January 13th 2012 offshore the Giglio Island (Tuscany, Italy), with the loss of 32 lives. Salvage operation of the vessel started immediately after the wreck. This operation was the largest and most expensive maritime salvage ever attempted on a wrecked ship and it ended in July 2014 when the Costa Concordia was removed from the Giglio Island, and dragged in the port of Genoa where it was dismantled. The refloating and removal phases of the Costa Concordia were monitored, in the period between 14th and 27th of July, exploiting SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images acquired by the X-band COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellation in crisis mode. The main targets of the monitoring system were: (i) the detection of possible spill of pollutant material from the vessel and (ii) to exclude that oil slicks, illegally produced by other vessels, could be improperly linked to the naval convoy during its transit along the route between the Giglio Island and the port of Genoa. Results point out that the adopted monitoring system, through the use of the COSMO-SkyMed constellation, can be profitably employed to monitor emergency phases related to single ship or naval convoy over wide areas and with a suitable temporal coverage. Furthermore, the refloating and removal phases of the Costa Concordia were a success because no pollution was produced during the operations. &copy; 2015 The Authors.

Abstract:This paper presents a efficent conflict detection and resolution (CDR) method for an aerial vehicle sharing airspace with other aerial vehicles. It is based on a conflict detection (CD) algorithm (axis-aligned minimum bounding box) and conflict resoluction (CR) algorithm (genetic algorithms) to find safe trajectories. Monte-Carlo estimation is used to evaluate the best predicted trajectories considering different sources of uncertainty such as thewind, the inaccuracies in the vehiclemodel and limitations of on-board sensors and control system. Simulations are performed in different scenarios and conditions of wind to test the method. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

Abstract:Anisotropic etching of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron-carbon-nitrogen (BCN) basal plane can be an exciting platform to develop well-defined structures with interesting properties. Here, we developed an etching process of atomically thin h-BN and BCN layers to fabricate nanoribbons (NRs) and other distinct structures by annealing in H<inf>2</inf>and Ar gas mixture. BCN and h-BN films are grown on Cu foil by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using solid camphor and ammonia borane as carbon, nitrogen and boron source, respectively. Formation of micron size well-defined etched holes and NRs are obtained in both h-BN and BCN layers by the post growth annealing process. The etching process of h-BN and BCN basal plane to fabricate NRs and other structures with pronounced edges can open up new possibilities in 2D hybrid materials. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:Immobilized enzymes are used as biocatalysts for analytical purposes in diagnostics and for preparative purposes in large scale industrial processes. Immobilization can increase the half-life, improve the stability, and increase the catalytic activity of an enzyme. It facilitates the separation and recovery of the catalyst from the reaction products, and allows for multiple use of the biocatalysts. Graphene oxide nanosheets were decorated with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPGO) and functionalized with cyanuric chloride (SPGO-CC) to serve as solid support for the covalent immobilization of enzymes. Xylanase was attached to the functionalized nanocomposite with a yield of 215 mg protein pergram SPGO-CC. The kinetic constants of the immobilized (of the free soluble) xylanase are K<inf>m</inf>=4.9 (4.1) mg/mL, v<inf>max</inf>=1.6 (1.7)&mu;mol min<sup>-1</sup>mL<sup>-1</sup>, and k<inf>cat</inf>=82 (91) min<sup>-1</sup>, indicating a minimal impairment of catalytic activity by covalent coupling. The immobilized xylanase has shallow pH and temperature optima of 6.5 and 60&deg;C. It retains 70% of the original activity after 10 cycles of 15min incubation with substrate (polymeric xylan) at 60&deg;C. It retains 80% of the original catalytic activity after 3.5months storage at 4&deg;C, whereas the free, soluble enzyme retains only 50%. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:Poly (butyl acrylate) (PBA) latices with controllable particle size (90&ndash;350&nbsp;nm) were synthesized via one-step batch emulsion polymerization in the presence of different species of electrolyte. The evolution of particle size and number as a function of monomer conversion were tracked in order to investigate the effect of electrolyte species on the particle stability. For electrolyte with different anions, the particle size of final latices decreased with increasing pH of the aqueous phase and the sequence was Na<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf>&lt; NaHCO<inf>3</inf>&lt; Na<inf>2</inf>C<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf>&lt; NaCl, latices with Na<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf>showed some particular performance and possessed of a particle size up to 347.4&nbsp;nm; for electrolyte with different valences of counter ion, while achieving the similar particle size (Ca. 120&nbsp;nm), an obvious variance in ionic strength was found (0.03, 0.016 and 0.0035&nbsp;mol&nbsp;kg<sup>&minus;1</sup>for Na<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>and Al<sup>3+</sup>). It indicate that electrolyte affects the particle stability by adjusting the pH of the aqueous phase and ionic strength, further controls the particle coagulation. As a result, latices with designated final particle size and distribution can be obtained by choosing the appropriate type and concentration of electrolyte. &copy; 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Abstract:Post-stack inversion of seismic data is routinely carried out to derive acoustic impedance (AI) and, hence petrophysical properties in an area. We have been introducing here an uncommon methodology of inverting post-stack seismic data into porosity from porosity log. The post-stack inversion for estimation of direct porosity is performed by utilizing an estimated porosity wavelet, low frequency model and model based inversion. This methodology is implemented on two types of 2D post-stack seismic dataset; (a) deep water Mahanadi (MN) offshore containing gas hydrate sediments and (b) clay rich, shaly sediments in Krishna-Godavari (K-G) shallow offshore. The total porosity (&phi;) estimated from density log for the depth interval of 1725-2032 m ranging from 49 to 75% has been used as input for porosity inversion from the seismic data of unconsolidated sediments at 1701 m bathymetry in MN basin. The total porosity for the depth interval of 410-1494 m ranging from 5 to 45% has been used as input for porosity inversion from the 2D post-stack seismic data of shallow offshore sediments at 31 m bathymetry in K-G basin. This prediction is applied to dataset having good (for MN) and poor correlation (for K-G) between AI and porosity. In MN basin, the porosity along 2D multichannel seismic ranges from 53 to 65% in the gas hydrated zone with maximum value of 70% at the free gas filled unconsolidated sediment below the bottom simulating reflector (BSR). The water bearing silt/clay sediments indicates porosity of about 60-65% below the seafloor. In K-G basin, the porosity in Raghavapuram shale varies from 13 to 30% with maximum value of 52% is observed in Paleocene sediments. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:In this paper, it is proposed a visual surveillance system for multiple UAVs under communication constrains. In previousworks, a dynamic task allocation algorithm was designed for assigning patrolling and tracking tasks between multiple robots. The idea was to assign the intruders dynamically among the robots using one-to-one coordination technique. However due to communication constrains, every UAVs could store different information. In this paper, local information about targets is obtained by a visual algorithm that detectsmoving objects during surveillance tasks using fixed low-cost monocular RGB-camera connected to an on-board computer. This system was tested in a urban surveillance scenario, implemented in an indoor test-bed, under EC-SAFEMOBIL project. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

Abstract:Temperature and presence of water bodies are known to influence the transmission dynamics of schistosomiasis. In this work, effects of water bodies (taken in context of rainfall patterns) and temperature from 1950 to 2000 are considered in the model. With the aid of Geographic Information System (GIS), the reproduction number is mapped on the Zimbabwean country. Results of the mapping show high reproduction numbers along the Lowveld and the Zambezi valley catchment area. High reproduction numbers suggest high levels of schistosomiasis. This result suggests more control efforts should be targeted in these areas with high reproduction numbers. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:Optimization analyses of two heat exchanger networks show that if the optimization objective of the heat exchanger network can be expressed as an explicit function of all the independent variables, its derivatives with respect to each variable can offer the optimal solution. If there is no explicit function, optimization problem can be solved by using the Lagrange multiplier method, which combines the optimization objective and the constraints. However, heat exchanger networks with many heat exchangers have a large number of variables and constraint equations in the Lagrange function, which slows the optimization solution. A crank mechanism is used as an example to indicate that the Lagrange multiplier method can be simplified in a generalized coordinate instead of Cartesian coordinates. Inspired by the use of generalized coordinates in multi-body systems, the entransy balance equation for the heat exchanger network is introduced here as a new constraint to replace the conventional constraints of heat transfer and energy conservation equations for the optimization of a loop-connected heat exchanger network. As a result, the number of variables and constraints in the Lagrange multiplier function is reduced and the solution is simplified. In this sense, the entransy balance equation can be termed as the generalized constraint. Finally, the reason for the simplification function of the entransy dissipation-based generalized constraint is explored. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract:The hybrid advanced oxidation process (AOP) of sono-photolysis, in which sonication and photolysis (UV-C/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) are applied simultaneously, is known to give effective degradation of several bio-recalcitrant pollutants. This study has attempted to identify the links and interactions between the mechanisms of individual AOPs of sonolysis and photolysis, when applied simultaneously. Experimental results have been analyzed concurrently with the simulations of cavitation bubble dynamics. It is revealed that oxidizing (OH) radicals generated through photolysis contribute mostly to degradation reactions. Due to highly sporadic nature of transient cavitation, the contribution of sonolysis to degradation is rather subordinate as compared to photolysis. Nonetheless, faster degradation and higher mineralization in sono-photolysis, as compared to photolysis alone, essentially points at supportive role of ultrasound in the hybrid AOP. Addition of electrolytes (or salt) to the reaction mixture during sono-photolysis treatment causes effective partitioning of the pollutant molecules in the interfacial region of transient cavitation bubble, which results in further enhancement of degradation kinetics and mineralization. Although the present study has employed Carmoisine as model pollutant, the mechanistic principles identified in this study, and their manifestations in terms of degradation/mineralization of pollutants are applicable to any other bio-recalcitrant pollutant. &copy; 2015 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

Abstract:Using wavelet technique for detection of height varying vertical and horizontal wavelengths of gravity waves, the absolute values of gravity wave momentum fluxes are estimated from High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS) temperature measurements. Two years of temperature measurements (2005 December-2007 November) from HIRDLS onboard EOS-Aura satellite over the globe are used for this purpose. The least square fitting method is employed to extract the 0-6 zonal wavenumber planetary wave amplitudes, which are removed from the instantaneous temperature profiles to extract gravity wave fields. The vertical and horizontal wavelengths of the prominent waves are computed using wavelet and cross correlation techniques respectively. The absolute momentum fluxes are then estimated using prominent gravity wave perturbations and their vertical and horizontal wavelengths. The momentum fluxes obtained from HIRDLS are compared with the fluxes obtained from ground based Rayleigh LIDAR observations over a low latitude station, Gadanki (13.5&deg;N, 79.2&deg;E) and are found to be in good agreement. After validation, the absolute gravity wave momentum fluxes over the entire globe are estimated. It is found that the winter hemisphere has the maximum momentum flux magnitudes over the high latitudes with a secondary maximum over the summer hemispheric low-latitudes. The significance of the present study lies in introducing the wavelet technique for estimating the height varying vertical and horizontal wavelengths of gravity waves and validating space based momentum flux estimations using ground based lidar observations. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:This study aims to quantify the environmental impact of two retail distribution networks and offer consumers a channel that is more beneficial to the environment. The environmental impact of replenishing the packaged beverages sold in convenience stores (CVSs) and hypermarkets is assessed using the streamlined life-cycle assessment (LCA) approach. In this study, the life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) for packaged beverages up to the point of sale illustrates the distribution-level environmental impacts of truck transportation. The matched-pair t-test shows that the environmental impacts of transporting 1800 cartons of 24-pack/10 oz. beverages to be sold in Carrefour and 7-11 stores is different at a significance level of 0.1. The transport-focused LCA is used to improve the understanding and compare the environmental characteristics of the two distribution and retail systems. This study constitutes a vehicle for communicating to both internal and external stakeholders the environmental profiles of distributing the same product sold through two retail channels. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:CO discharged by mine flame-proof vehicles can result in wrong signals to the early-warning system of spontaneous combustion often occurred in coal mines as CO is one of the index gases when forecasting and early warning coal spontaneous combustion in underground mine. Traditional method is to install sensors in the air intake system to monitor the CO concentration. In the present paper, a number of CO distribution simulations are performed using commercial FLUENT software. When a mine flame-proof vehicle running at a speed of 7 m s<sup>-1</sup>in an underground tunnel while the inlet velocity of roadway is 3 m s<sup>-1</sup>, dynamic distribution of CO concentration discharged by mine flame-proof vehicle within t = 1-5 s is obtained, and variation of CO concentration on static monitoring points is obtained at the same time while simulating. The simulation results indicate that: the region of CO concentration greater than 0.0024% was in the scope from vehicle tailgate to the back which is irregular shapes, and it reduces to less than 0.0024% in short time, about 1 s. In front of the vehicle CO concentration is always a fixed value or even lower than 0.0019%. For comparative analysis, 4 monitoring points are arranged to monitor the CO concentration in actual underground roadway. And the actual measured data verified the correctness of numerical simulation data. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:Ultra-high purification of terbium (Tb) by vacuum distillation and external getter was investigated. More than 20 kinds of impurity elements were analyzed by glow discharge mass spectrometry (GDMS) and inert gas analysis (IGA). The analysis results show that total impurities decrease from 1114 ppm to 63 ppm. High volatile metallic impurities such as Mg, Ca, Mn, Zn, and Tm can be reduced effectively after distillation. The oxygen (O) concentration can be decreased to 1.8 ppm after deoxidation process, which currently is one of the best results in the contemporary studies. The chemical driving force for deoxidation has been calculated in this paper. The different deoxidation results of Tb metal with various purity have been discussed in detail using the secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS). Finally, a ultra-high purity Tb with low concentration of O can be obtained through vacuum distillation and external getter method. &copy; 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:Cembranoids, 14-membered carbocyclic diterpenes composed of four isoprene units, are mainly found in plants of the Nicotiana and Pinus genera, as well as in soft coral and other marine organisms. We summarise the chemical structures of the eighty-seven naturally occurring tobacco cembranoids (1-52), nor-cembranoids (53-74), seco-cembranoids (75-82) and cyclised cembranoids (83-87) reported to date. The most prevalent cembranoids in tobacco are (1S,2E,4S,7E,11E)-cembra-2,7,11-triene-4,6-diol (1) and (1S,2E,4R,7E,11E)-cembra-2,7,11-triene-4,6-diol (2), which are biosynthesised in the plastid from the reactions of geranylgeranyl diphosphate with cembrantrien-ol synthase and cytochrome P450 hydroxylase via the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate metabolic pathway. The accumulation of cembranoids in tobacco is affected by genetic and environmental factors, including fertiliser, water and light exposure, soil-type and temperature. Tobacco-derived cembranoids are known to display antifungal, antibacterial, anti-human immunodeficiency virus, anti-tumour and neuroprotective properties. A large number of biologically active (primarily anti-invasive, anti-proliferative, anti-migratory and neuroprotective) compounds have been prepared from the semisynthesis of tobacco cembranoids, many via biocatalytic methods. The documented bioactivities of tobacco cembranoids make them excellent templates for the future development of drugs to treat cancer, AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke and other neurodegenerative diseases. These findings indicated that although tobacco has long been associated with negative effects on human health, it may ultimately be able to play a therapeutic role. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:During a recent literature review, we have noticed that researchers used tubes made of materials having a wide range of wettability, including plastics and metals, to pack powders for wettability determination using the Washburn capillary rise (WCR) method. Most studies applying WCR have focused on the effects of powder properties and their packing methods on the contact angle, while neglecting the role of packing tube. Although the ratio of packed powder surface area to tube surface area is large, we believe that tube wettability could have a significant effect on powder wettability determined using the WCR method. In this paper, we report that when water was penetrating the packed powder inside hydrophobic tubes, the water front along the tube wall was severely pinned, and in some cases, it was completely pinned at the support/packing/tube wall interface until the water had penetrated all the way up the packed powder. Using hydrophobic tubes limited the water rise to the powder region, which resulted in contact angles that were larger (up to ~37&deg;) than ones obtained using hydrophilic tubes, especially when the tube size was small. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:The H<sup>-</sup>magnetron source provides about 100 mA H<sup>-</sup>beam to be match into the radio-frequency quadrupole accelerator. As H<sup>-</sup>beam traverses through low energy transport, it ionizes the residual gas and electrons are repelled and positive ions are trapped in the beam, due to negative potential of the beam, providing charge neutralization for the H<sup>-</sup>beam. The neutralization time for the critical density depends upon the background gas and its pressure. Critical density for xenon gas at 35 keV is about 43 times smaller than that of hydrogen and stripping cross section is only 5 times than that of hydrogen gas. We are using xenon gas to reduce neutralization time and to improve transmission through the 200 MeV linac. We are also using pulse nitrogen gas to improve transmission and stability of polarized H<sup>-</sup>beam from optically pumped polarized ion source. &copy; 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

Abstract:Amino acid substituted zinc phthalocyanines which are capable of reversing their charge from negative to positive in response to tumor microenvironment have been prepared by the isoelectric pHs regulation and charge reversal sensitivity enhancement. The charge reversal abilities of the prepared zinc phthalocyanines were judged by their isoelectric pHs and zeta potential values. The UV-Vis spectra, singlet oxygen generation ability, cellular uptake and in vitro anticancer ability of the prepared zinc phthalocyanines were investigated to study the influences of charge reversal on photodynamic activities. Charge reversible tetra- and octa-substituted glutamic acid ZnPcs showed enhanced singlet oxygen generation ability, cellular uptake and photocytotoxicity towards cancer cells, and were considered as promising photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:Multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) was hybridized with aluminum hydroxide utilizing aluminum trichloride hexahydrate as a precursor to prepare a filler that can be utilized for a thermally conductive yet electrically insulative polymer composite. The thermal conductivity of an alumina sphere/thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) mixture (100 parts) was enhanced 2 to 3-fold when 5 parts of this hybrid material (Al-CNT hybrid) was added as a synergizer for thermal conduction. This enhancement was better than that by CNT. Moreover, the electrical conductivity increase due to the added Al-CNT hybrid was marginal, whereas the increase was striking when CNT itself was added instead. &copy; 2015 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

Abstract:This work is devoted to an adaptation of the conjugate gradient method for the identification of heat flux densities provided by two mobile sources on a two-dimensional geometry. This adaptation is based on a sliding-time window in order to achieve quasi-online identification of unknown time-dependent parameters. The proposed method ensures sequential in time iterative regularization in order to deal with the ill-posed nature of inverse heat conduction problem (IHCP). The studied configuration is issued from experimental reflections in order to investigate a practical case. A set of fixed sensors is considered while heating sources trajectories are accurately known. Measurements provided by sensors are disturbed according to a realistic Gaussian noise. Several strategies are detailed in this communication (adaptive integration interval, sliding time window, initialization improvement, choice of the sliding window size). In each situation, the benefit in terms of delay reduction is discussed in regards with the identification accuracy. It is shown that such methodology provides an attractive procedure consistent with adaptive control aims and real time signal processing. &copy; 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Abstract:Although unsteady and electrokinetic flows are widely used in microfluidics, there is unfortunately no velocimeter today that can measure the random velocity fluctuation at high temporal and spatial resolution simultaneously in microfluidics. Here we, for the first time, theoretically study the temporal resolution of laser&nbsp;induced fluorescence photobleaching anemometer (LIFPA) and experimentally verify that LIFPA can have simultaneously ultrahigh temporal $$({\sim } 4\,\upmu \hbox {s})$$(&sim;4&mu;s) and spatial $$({\sim }203\,\hbox {nm})$$(&sim;203nm) resolution and can measure velocity fluctuation up to at least 2 kHz, whose corresponding wave number is about $$6\times 10^6\,{/}\hbox {m}$$6&times;106/m in an electrokinetically forced unsteady flow in microfluidics. &copy; 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract:This paper presents a compact 2.45 GHz single feed directional circularly polarized (CP) microstrip antenna for radio frequency identification (RFID) applications. The proposed antenna comprises a dodecagonal microstrip patch embedded with an irregular polygonal slot, fabricated on an FR4 substrate. Two antennas, one with right-handed circular polarization (RHCP) and the other with left-handed circular polarization (LHCP), both resonating at a frequency of 2.45 GHz are presented. The measurement results show a 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth of 5.5%, a 10 dB impedance bandwidth of 5.7% for both the antennas, a peak gain of 4.82 dBi for RHCP antenna and 4.67 dBi for LHCP antenna. In addition, the antennas provide symmetrical patterns with 88&ordm; half-power beam width. The overall size of the antenna is 50mm &times; 50mm &times; 1.6mm and offers an area reduction of 21.17%. &copy; 2016, Electromagnetics Academy. All rights reserved.

Abstract:Generally, the major obstacles for efficient gene delivery are cellular internalization and endosomal escape of nucleic acid such as plasmid DNA (pDNA) or small interfering RNA (siRNA). We previously developed Pluronic P123 modified polypropyleneimine (PPI)/pDNA (P123-PPI/pDNA) polyplexes as a gene delivery system. The results showed that P123-PPI/pDNA polyplexes revealed higher transfection efficiency than PPI/pDNA polyplexes in multidrug resistant breast cancer cells. As a continued effort, the present investigation on the factors influencing the transfection efficiency, cellular uptake mechanisms, and intracellular fate of P123-PPI/pDNA polyplexes is reported. The presence of P123 was the main factor influencing the transfection efficiency of P123-PPI/pDNA polyplexes in MCF-7/ADR cells, but other parameters, such as N/P ratio, FBS concentration, incubation time and temperature were important as well. The endocytic inhibitors against clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), caveolae-mediated endocytosis (CvME), and macropinocytosis were involved in the internalization to investigate their effects on the cellular uptake and transfection efficiency of P123-PPI/pDNA polyplexes in vitro. The data showed that the internalization of P123-PPI/pDNA polyplexes was obtained from both CME and CvME. Colocalization experiments with TRITC-transferrin (CME indicator), Alexa Fluor 555-CTB (CvME indicator), monoclonal anti-&alpha;-tubulin (microtubule indicator), and LysoTracker Green (Endosome/lysosome indicator) were carried out to confirm the internalization routes. The results showed that both CME and CvME played vital roles in the effective transfection of P123-PPI/pDNA polyplexes. Endosome/lysosome system and skeleton, including actin filament and microtubule, were necessary for the transportation after internalization. &copy; 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:Crop monitoring and harvesting by ground robots in steep slope vineyards is an intrinsically complex challenge, due to two main reasons: harsh conditions of the terrain and reduced time availability and unstable localization accuracy of the Global Positioning System (GPS). In this paper the use of agricultural wireless sensors as artificial landmarks for robot localization is explored. The Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), of Bluetooth (BT) based sensors/technology, has been characterized for distance estimation. Based on this characterization, a mapping procedure based on Histogram Mapping concept was evaluated. The results allow us to conclude that agricultural wireless sensors can be used to support the robot localization procedures in critical moments (GPS blockage) and to create redundant localization information. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.
